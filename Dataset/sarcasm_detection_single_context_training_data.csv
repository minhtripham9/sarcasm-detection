0,"Ah, a nice guy.","oh god. I have had several awkward tinder dates. the worst was this guy who was 23 and had pretty much grown up on the computer. usually don't mind guys having a gaming hobby. any hobby is great as it shows you have a passion for something. but it should be a hobby it shouldn't rule your life. anyway I offered to meet him at the uni we both attended to grab a coffee, but he insisted on going to the local shopping complex despite the fact that he didn't drive. no idea how he got there. he ended up being around 30 mins late. ok. I can deal with that. when we finally meet he's so nervous he's shaking like a Chihuahua. and barely able to speak. I get it. first dates can be nerve-wracking. we sit down to sushi and there is absolute dead silence. I start asking him questions to start the conversation but all I get is 2 word replies...right. this is getting a bit more frustrating.I even ask him questions about what games he likes (I do know a bit about games) but all I get is condescending answers. i'm starting to feel more like an interrogator than a date. suddenly he perks up and goes ""uhh...I have to go. there's a LAN party on"" ok mate. you're not feeling comfortable on this date thats fine. even though you suggested it and you were so confident online. so we part ways. the kicker comes about 4:30am the next morning. i'm working an overnight shift at Maccas and this group of guys come in. Chihuahua boy is in the group, being a whole lot more confident (I get it, it's easier being social with friends). they walk in talking about ""bitches"" and how ""fucking fake gamer bitches"" ruined their Lan Party (I wish I was making this up) he goes to order. and doesn't realise it's me. they leave a huge mess behind (i'm talking purposely smearing ice cream on the table and chairs plus more) because it's the employees job to clean up. the next afternoon i get a message from him asking if i'd like to meet up with him again. I politely said no. He called me a fat bitch. never saw him again."

0,You need new friends.,"My friends (19,20M) just humiliated me (19M) with a cruel joke and I'm questioning if they're really my friends. Hey, this just happened so I apologise in advance if I come off as a bit salty/upset. For some context, I'm living out of home and am in my first year of university; scraping by and working my arse off. I make ends meet and I have a modest income, but not really any expendable income; and sometimes find myself with no money available to me at all; but with no outstanding costs until my next pay check. (I can't go on benefits because my parents' income is too high, yet they won't offer financial assistance themselves. Not really relevant but just setting the scene). My friend, let's call him T, however is a professional soccer player, and has a 60k+ income that he will often throw on roulette or something like that. He's an old friend of mine from when we were 6, and I see him semi-regularly. My other friend, C; is just average. Both live at home and thus have expendable incomes (especially in the case of T). T invited me around this evening for some video games and kicking back, which I was keen for; seeing as it was catching up yet with no cost attached. When I'm about to leave; he texts me and says that there's been a change of plan; that we're going out for dinner at this semi-expensive restaurant and that he'd love for me to come. I initially decline, saying that I can't afford it and that I'd catch up with them after. However; he begins to go ""oh, but C has trekked it all the way from X"" and insists that I come along; saying that he's shouting (paying for) the feed anyway. After he pesters me some more, I cave and say I'll be there. The dinner goes pretty well! Some banter, good food, and overall I thought it was a good time. That was until we got to the end of the meal. T suddenly looks panicked and looks in his wallet. ""Oh shit, I don't have my card with me"". He then goes on to show me that he's got enough in cash to pay for his section of the meal, and C has enough to pay for his, but then begins to laugh at me and begin giggling at my expense because ""you're up shit creek mate, too poor to pay for your own meal"". Then goes on to laugh about the fact that I'll either have to dine and dash (which I'm not comfortable with and honestly would never do) or that I'm straight up fucked. The whole time I'm trying to kind of laugh it off as banter but as he persists with his insistence that he doesn't have enough to pay for me; I get more and more uncomfortable and pretty upset. He then begins to jokingly call the waiter over for the check, and says that there's an issue. I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to try and get some fresh air and maybe try and work out what the fuck is going on; and when I return they've paid for their individual shares, and have apparently told the waiter that I can't pay for mine. Manager comes up and says he'll have to call the police, all while my friends have walked out of the restaurant. Just before he rings, however; my friend comes back and says he'll pay for me, and that he has to bail me out ONCE AGAIN (I've never taken a cent of his money before, I make a point of being self sufficient and not taking bail outs.) So after I was humiliated at a restaurant I actually quite like and sometimes go to with my family (and that I can never go to again); T begins to just spend the rest of the time laughing at my expense and about how great that display of ""banter"" was. I'm pretty fucking steamed so I just kind of walk off and haven't replied to his texts. Banter is one thing, but public humiliation like that... It just seems a bit much. Am I overreacting and need to get some thicker skin? Was I just an idiot to think my loaded friend just wanted to be generous, or should I have seen it coming? This isn't the first joke at my expense and sadly I don't think it'll be the last. Tl;dr - my rich friends publicly humiliated me for being broke, pls read the main text."

They had to do a music video and switch the lyrics of a song to have it be science related, so they chose Survivor's ""The Eye of the Tiger"" and turned it into ""The Bones of our Body"". Everybody came to our house and we shot the music video in one shot in our garage. One of the teammates was this REALLY quiet kid, but still made the effort to sing along. When everybody's parents came to pick them up, Shy Guy's mother INSISTED on watching the video. It wasn't ready of course, I still had to edit it. But nope! She ended up seeing the whole thing damn thing through the camcorder screen...and she didn't like it. She told me to film it again and to make sure Shy Guy came out more (when some of the teammates left already!). So everybody had to return to our house and film again because of a crazy lady. Oh yeah! And she stood behind the camera to make SURE that Shy Guy came out. WTF! She was a known psycho, so we figured it was best to do it again to shut her up."

Because the latter methods leave more room for survival, women tend to survive suicide attempts at higher rates than men."

""To enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal."""

0,What the fuck just happened here,"The thing about Shyvanna is... Vaginas exude a large amount of heat on normal human women, let alone on certain female half-dragons, whose body temperatures would only naturally be much higher than a normal human's. If one were to approach Shyvana's bare vagina, especially if she was aroused, you would probably be able to feel the heat of it on your skin. The natural heat is also probably conducive to arousal in its own right. Much like a 15 year old going through puberty and getting erections at random, a side effect of being a half-breed is probably often, unprovoked arousal. Who knows, it may even be permanent. Shyvana might literally be ""in heat"" at all times. On top of what may be almost perpetual wetness between her thighs, her naturally high body temperature probably makes it difficult for her to wear human clothes comfortably (especially tight, reinforced armor). She probably sweats profusely in her armor, enough to drench herself in only one short outing to Summoner's Rift. But then again she may get off on the feeling of being wrapped so tightly, so to speak. The sensation of her wet vagina would probably resemble putting your finger into a bath of hot honey. The juices more viscous than normal and just hot enough that you almost risk a burn. Imagine the smell and the taste of her inner thighs after one match. Wet and sticky with a musky odor and all salty-sweet from the combination of her various juices."

I was lazy and missed the date to pay the fine so I had to go to court to pay it. I decided since I was there to see if there were any loop holes I could use to get out of it. A bit of googling and I found out the cop who wrote the ticket has to be there in order to testify you were in fact speeding. She wasn't. So, there I sit waiting for my turn hoping she doesn't get there before its my turn. I strike up a convo with another guy there. He got a speeding ticket for speeding trying to get his daughter to a hospital. I tell him what I've found and to try it that way. He doesn't listen, and tries the ""I'm guilty but I have a good excuse."" He gets fined and points against his record. Finally, I'm the last one to get in front of the judge. Still no cop to be seen. So, I ask for the case to be dismissed because the state can't provide a witness against me. The judge grins and talks to me a bit about football, as it is the fall in the south, and then dismisses the ticket. So, the moral of the story here is if you get a speeding ticket, do your due diligence on how to get out of it."

You mention how your marriage fell apart mostly because your wife stopped caring about her appearance. You mention how when you were finally divorced, started looking online and marveled at how young, beautiful women would reply to your messages. Hint: Most likely has nothing to do with your appearance and everything to do with other reasons (Plenty of women lookin for a father figure out there). You can't help to stress how great is the make up advice that this 12-year-younger, soon to be step mom bestows upon your daughters. (How old are they? Not mentioned here). And finally.. you are concerned about the light in which your ex-wife paints you. If I were you, I would focus my energy on building a meaningful relationship with my current woman rather than worry what my ex says (with merit or not) about our motivations to break up. Move on. She is doing so in the best way she can. And frankly, while is not the best, at least it makes more sense than your own account."

It's not like lifting weights, where you do leg day on Wednesday and don't worry for another week. If I were you, I'd run a distance of 2-3 miles, 3 times a week. A 3 mile run is quick and easy, and you'll quickly build up the endurance you need to enjoy running longer. But running 7 miles once a week is like doing a big deadlift, once a month, and expecting it to get easy."

0,You should have invited your friend's Mom to his party as your date.,"My friend and his girlfriend made his party ""couples only"" last minute and pretty much left me out to dry 7 hours before it started last night Hi Reddit, so I have never used this site before. I was actually recommend it by a family friend. So I live in Pennsylvania and I just completed my Sophomore year. I was super excited to be on summer break and just relax over the summer. My friends had organised this party last night to celebrate and just have a good time. I normally dress really smart just in general because I care about my appearance. Yesterday morning at around 11 am I got a phone call from my friend that was hosting the party. I answered my phone and he goes "" Bro, you need to find a date"". I was confused as holy hell as to why, so I did the natural thing and asked him. He said "" Bro, I and Sasha (girlfriend) have made the party couples only. You need to find a date or you can't come."" Before I even had a chance to respond he hang up on me. So I sat in my room thinking Christ, where am I going to find a date. All the girls I know really well are in relationships and who is going to want to go on a date now on such short notice. So I sent him a text telling him this and he said "" Sorry bro, you can't come then"". I had 7 hours to find a date. If you can find a date in 7 hours more power to you, but to me that sounds like an impossible task. I decided fuck it, I don't need this I am going to go out by myself. I went down to the mall. The mall near my place has this outside part to it. It is mainly restaurants and stuff but they stay open way after the mall closes. I hanged around there and there was a local band so I just listened to them. But the whole night it was bugging me that 7 hours before the party they told me this. Where the hell was I suppose to find a date in 7 hours. Did they expect me to wave my magic wand and make one appear. All the girls I know already have boyfriends and, I was stranded. Do I even bring this up to them or do I just leave it alone and move on? **tl;dr**: Friends made a party couples only and only gave me 7 hours notice."

I thought ""white boy"" was just a descriptor, even when preceding or following a beat down, not a slur. I just believed I was a piece of shit. Why else would people I don't know hurt me? But it was an attitude that was reinforced, literally beaten into me at times, and it became fact for me. Part of learning to love myself was reinforcing the opposite. Telling myself, out loud, especially look at myself in the mirror, that I'm a good, worthwhile person. Repetition of positives or negatives as beliefs can be incredibly powerful."

0,Don't care if it's true... this deserves to be higher.,"I've had just the opposite. I was the custodian. (Cleaning man?) When I was in college, every winter break I would go to the temp agency and they would place you in all types of temporary jobs. Some were temporary construction where you'd only go in for a day. Some you have for weeks or the entire month break because they needed someone immediately and couldn't find a full time replacement. Anyway, this one winter I was given a custodial job in an office park, basically emptying trash and doing minor cleanups in each office. It was great because I didn't start until 530ish and could finish by 930 or 10 and go out for the night and then sleep in. Generally I didn't run into any people, as most people were gone for the night. But in one office for the first 3 nights of work I notice this beautiful lady, probably in her mid to late 30s, all alone, deep into her spreadsheets at 8pm. At first I would just knock, apologize for bothering her, change out her garbage, and wish her a good night. After I noticed her being in the office late every night I would walk in, crack some corny jokes, comment on the pictures she displayed in her office, and lamely tried to flirt, fumbling through my words. I suppose this became endearing and by the end of the second week she would seem to be relieved to see me, offering her a chance to take a break and relax for a moment. One day as I'm reaching for her garbage pail, she grabbed my biceps and said ""not too bad"" and laughed. I laughed and shook my head, thinking she was just messing with me (I'm very normal/average build) but couldn't help imagining in my 20 year old brain that this possible meaned something. The next night, she's the only person in the office again at 8 and she's dressed like it's straight out of a porno in an office setting. Tight pencil skirt, heels, a tight button down blouse, and glasses (which she didn't wear every night). I decided that after yesterday I was okay to shoot my shot so I commented that her outfit was really working for her. She smiled at me and unbuttoned one more button and asked ""does it look better like this? Or that"" as she re-buttoned the button. Without missing a beat, I replied ""did you try unbuttoning 2 more buttons?"". For some reason this makes her crack up and she stands up, approaches me, and slaps me on the chest...but then she unbuttons 2 more buttons, gets closer, and starts rubbing my chest then starts to kiss me then pulls back. She then pushes me and tells me to sit her chair. She unbuttons her shirt completely, revealing her bra, and proceeds to get on her knees and unbuckle my pants. She blows me for maybe 90 seconds total and my head is spinning and I'm done. Then she looked up at me and laughed, buttoned her self back up and said ""go on and get out of here"". I got to the bar that night and my friends drinks were on me. The next night when I walked in, I say my hello, and she proceeds to direct me steP by step exactly what I needed to do and exactly how I was going to fuck her. The first night she told me she was going to bend over the the desk, the next night she explained that she would be laying with her back on the desk and I would be finishing on her chest, the night after that she told me to sit in her chair and she would ride me. Every night for those next two weeks was slightly different but with her directing every single aspect of it. To be honest I had never experienced anything like that and it was hot as hell. For those 20 mins each night, she was completely in control of everything and it really got her off. I let her know when it was my last day and that I would be driving back to college the next afternoon. She told to pick her up on her lunch break and she blew me while I drive around town before dropping her off. I can't say any experiences that next semester in college lived up to it. We did not stay in contact after that."

The other day, Saturday, I was working the cash register. My basic duties include ringing people up, answering questions, greeting, etc. We close at 9p, just to reiterate. So I'm greeting, and some people walk up to ask me questions about where a particular rug is, what chairs might go with it, stuff like that. I answer what I can and then offer to call someone over to the rug section. They then ask, ""what time do you close again?"" Me: ""oh, 9o'clock tonight."" Looked at the clock, it was a bit before 7 I believe. Them: ""oh that's terrible! That's way too early. How are we supposed to shop and get out in time?"" I asked her if she was shopping for someone or herself, and segued the conversation into our holiday hours. Idk it just rubbed me the wrong way.

At first it'll feel like your full and that you have the desire to poop when your finger is in all the way, but you'll get used to it and you may even start to like it. Once you're in, curve your finger to the direction of your dick and you'll feel your prostate pretty easily considering it feels different as opposed to the rest of the chamber. Even have a go at it jerking off and it'll make your orgasm way more intense. In regards to poop, always do it after you evacuate and if your poop is on the runny side avoid all contact back there. It may smell so when you take your finger out, wash it, lube it, and go back in there soldier (if your healthy, the smell will eventually disappear and you'll be all clean inside). Afterwards immediately wash your hands before touching any other part of your body."

It was like Psycho or something, anal gland juice sprayed all up the walls and everything. Holy mackeral does that stuff smell bad!

The first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning is playing or watching smash. Whenever I'm not doing homework or working, I am watching youtube videos about smash or playing the game. Actually, even while working/doing homework, I listen to smash bros music or interviews, like old interviews from top players at past tournaments. In fact, as I'm typing this, I am listening to a PPMD interview from 2014. While I'm eating dinner/breakfast, I am simultaneously watching or listening to something related to smash. I even sometimes make little fantasies in my head about what would happen if I went back in time to 2005 or other time periods with the skill I have now and I imagine myself dominating. (I'm a decent sheik/falco player, but I would be incredible in 2005). I find myself watching the same interviews twice. Whenever I don't have anything to watch, I find some random tournament that I haven't seen yet or I rewatch sets. I've probably watched the Mew2king vs Leffen 6-0 like 30 times. And let me tell you this: I've never been happier. Thank you Smash brothers."

1,Sounds elitist and lib'ral... and it's just a theory.,"in a nutshell: The moon's gravitational pull on the earth distorts the surface, causing it to be (slightly) egg shaped -- the longitudinal axis of this imaginary ""egg"" is always pointing towards the moon. As the moon orbits the earth, this distortion of the earth is manifest in the rise and fall of the tides. There is a similar effect caused by the tug of the sun on the earth, though to a lesser extent. However, when the two forces line up, you get the spring tide (highest of the high tides) which occurs during the Full moon. It makes sense, when you understand that a full moon gets its ""full"" light from the sun being on the (nearly) the direct opposite side of the earth. Man kind has understood this for centuries. Long before O'Reilly was born."

Been 3 months. Advice? We were together 5 years and she broke it off in January because she thought it wasn't going anywhere. I admit it was because I didn't do the things that showed I was committed. I see why she had to go. Towards the end I thought I wanted to break up too. But I see now how incredibly stupid that was. I won't go into details. I love that girl so much. I've been out with new women, spent time with friends, hit the gym almost every day, been working on changing careers. But the thoughts of her are eating me alive guys. I've never experienced anything this difficult in my life. That girl is my world and I wasn't able to then give her what she deserved, or at least I thought I wasn't. I had some issues I should have addressed earlier on but I didn't know how to. I don't have a very good support group; very fragmented family and friends that aren't the best with real ""life stuff"". So I was juggling too much. Anyway, I just think that this is starting to get unhealthy. I'm doing healthy things like I should be, but nothing works. I honestly feel like that sweet beautiful girl and me were meant for each other but I fucked it up and ended up hurting her. It's the most agonizing pain I've ever dealt with."

1,"If playing a female character means you're gay or trans, my SO and his 8 female Blood-elf hunters he played when he used to multibox on WoW have got lots of 'splainin' to do.","People think I'm either trans or gay because I choose female characters/avatars in video games I'm a straight guy. I feel perfectly comfortable being a man and do not have any desires to become a woman in real life nor do I have any desires to be with another man. When I play games, I like to choose female characters. Especially when you have to create your own characters. It's just more fun o play as a female character. I don't feel the need to ""relate"" to my avatar, I enjoy the fantasy aspect of it just being fantasy and nothing to do with real life. My friends used to make fun of me in the beginning with games like World of Warcraft many years ago. It didn't bother me one bit cause that's how we all treat each other, we make fun of each other and tease each other and it was all fun and good. However, with the recent Pokemon GO app things have turned weird. I picked a female avatar like I always do and some of my friends who usually don't play games started playing as well. They found it weird that I had a female avatar. Some of them started asking me intimate questions like ""are you feeling okay with your gender?"" or do you have any problems that you are too ashamed to mention? They all refer to my avatar and how strange it is. I keep denying it but they never believe me. What can I tell them? **TL;DR**: I like having female avatars in video games. People don't get it and thing I want to change my gender or question my sexuality."

I was shopping around in my red shirt (with the bullseye on the front) and khaki pants when an elderly lady and who I assume was her grandson walked up to me. The lady asked if I knew where a certain CD was, because it wasn't where she thought it would be. I told her that I didn't work there, and wasn't very familiar with the layout of the store. She responded with, ""Well, maybe you shouldn't wear an employee's shirt if you're not an employee!"" I didn't quite know what to say to this, as I thought my shirt was very clearly red, and the actual employees' shirts were very clearly blue. Luckily, I didn't have to respond, because she stormed off before I had a chance to say anything."

Long time lurker, first time poster. I work retail at a store that's fairly large so it has a lot of rules. One such rule is that we need to check people's cards to see if there is a signature. If not, we need to see an i.d. with a name that matches the card. Since it's the holidays, we have been strictly enforcing this rule since there have been reports around our mall about people using stolen cards. Even if someone is using their spouses card and has the same last name, we can't use it because they could have stolen their card and gone on a crazy shopping spree because they are mad at them or seperated or for whatever crazy person reason. I had to use this rule on one lady tonight who just didn't seem to get it. M = Me, RL = Rude Lady M: *finishing the transaction when I notice there's no signature on her card* ""Can I also see an i.d. please?"" RL: *Shows i.d. that has the same last name but a different first name* M: ""I actually need to see an i.d. that has the same first name and last name as the card"". RL: ""That's my husbands card"". M: ""Unfortunately he does need to be present since it's his card and I do need to see his i.d. to complete the transaction"". RL: *in the most condescending tone you could image* "" He isn't here but you WILL be using this card"". M: ""Unfortunately our policy is that we need to see an i.d. that matches the card."" RL: ""I am not coming back to this store later so I WILL be using this card."" M: ""I'm sorry but I can't continue without your husband present"". RL: ""No, you WILL be using this card."" And that went on for another minute. She kept emphasizing ""will"" so much it was like she was trying to use the jedi mind trick on me. I wanted to shout "" You WILL be LEAVING THE STORE NOW"". The manager was called and approved the transaction since the lady had the same last name and my manager didn't know how rude she had been. Next time someone is that rude to me I'll just say ""sorry, your card doesn't have a signature and is therefore invalid. That is technically credit card fraud. Bye!""."

0,"For me, if I was carrying my husbands child, it would be a real blow to the chest for him to hold on to the stance that his life would still be pretty good without us, and that we're not just as important as a member of his family essentially.","During a eulogy for my grandfather, I said that he was the person I most loved in the world. My wife and I have been fighting now because of it. She thinks I did something wrong. I think she's being a brat. We've been married now for 2 years, and before that we dated for 3 years. Altogether we've been a couple for around 5 years. Let me start off by saying that I do love my wife and our soon-to-be son a lot. They are certainly 2 of the most important people in my life, but they are or were not the person I loved most. That was and always will be my grandfather for a host of different reasons. I think it should suffice to say that he raised me and did so many things to help me become the person I am today. Without him, I would be nothing, and that is why he holds such a special place in my life. I said as much at his funeral a few weeks back, and I'm not sorry for what I said. I could have understated things or chosen different words, but that is how I feel. To say or pretend otherwise would be a lie, and it's not like it's ever been a secret where my grandfather ranked in my life. I'm just not sure what my wife wants or expects of me. I can't change how I feel about my grandfather, but just because he was the person I cared for the most doesn't mean I don't deeply and truly love her or our future son. I know that it's disappointing for her to hear that I don't love her above everyone else, but I can't change that. The bottom line is, she wants me to take back what I said and apologize, but I don't feel like I did anything wrong. I'm not trying to be mean, but I don't know how she can ask that of me given how much he meant to me. I would be nothing without him, but without her I would still have a nice life. The two aren't comparable in any way. I would like to just move on and focus on preparing for our son's birth, but she can't seem to get past this. On the other hand, I can't bring myself to take back what I said, and it makes me angry that she's behaving like a child at such a bad time. We're at a huge impasse, and I don't know how to get us past this. Help/advice would be appreciated. --- **tl;dr**: Said in a eulogy for my grandfather that he was the most important person in my life. Wife got upset because she and our unborn son are not #1 in my world and now wants me to take it back and apologize. I refuse to do so since it is true and I can't help how I feel, not to mention my grandfather did far more for me than she or anyone else ever has, and she can't get past this. Don't know what to do."

0,Was expecting tree fiddy...,"Oysters When me and my best friend were 16 we went travelling in Ireland. He's Irish and has family in Ireland who were keeping an eye on us, so we weren't really on our own. Nonetheless it was our first glimpse of independence, even if we were peering at it through the protective arms of his family. Anyway, one night we decided to try and get served at a bar. We went in, my friend walked confidently up to the bar and asked for two pints. The bartender knew we were underage, after all how could anybody not. Nonetheless with a knowing look and a smile he poured us a pint each. About half way through this first pint a group of men walked into the bar and the whole atmosphere changed. It was clear these men were highly respected within this community. We decided to sidle on up to them and start a conversation. They took a liking to us and started buying us drinks. My memory fades rather abruptly at this point, next thing I remember is waking up on a boat. It turns out these men worked on a trawler. We got far to drunk and the men didn't know what to do with us, so they took us out on their boat for the day. Me and my friend tried to make our selves useful, but it was clear we had no idea what we were doing, much to the amusement of the trawler-men. Suddenly a quiet fear settled over the boat. We were heading right for a storm, and the captain, a haggard seaman of many years was scared. Told us later it was the worst storm he'd ever seen. Sure enough a wave came crashing into the side of the boat. We gathered ourselves up and looked around and my friend was nowhere to be seen. He'd been washed overboard by the wave. The captain flew out of his cabin, quickly tying a rope around his waste he dove into the water. There was a moments calm as everyone anxiously waited. A few bubbles floated to the surface. Then we a triumphant splash both captain and friend surfaced. The rest of the crewe dragged them both back on board. Without saying a word, the captain walks over to a pile of oysters and with a flick of his knife opens one up and hands it to the nearest man. It's clear what he is doing, we survived and we are toasting that fact. Since we don't have beer an oyster shall have to suffice. We raised our oysters and downed them in unison and they just weren't for me really..."

Quantum computers are extremely complex machines that use entanglement and superposition to allow for computing on a higher level than classical machines. Black holes are a giant mess of chaos that erases all information. Bose-Einstein condensates are a state of matter in which all particles share the same ""quantum wave"", which means that they behave in a very synchronous way. These are three very different things that you cannot simply throw together in a sentence and pray for it to sound intelligent. It doesn't! Bose-Einstein condensates can be used to simulate some aspects of black holes using sound, which is amazing. We call it *sonic black holes* and they are widely studied by the complex systems / condensed matter community. You create sound perturbations that can't escape from a fluid that is flowing more quickly than the local speed of sound, which effectively traps the sound like black holes trap light. There are many common properties between black holes and sonic black holes, it's fascinating. But I am not sure this is what your friend was thinking, though."

0,Did the younger brother give back the hush money since he blabbed and therefore didn't earn it?,"When my oldest son was in 8th grade, he decided to make money by doing his classmates homework. I knew something was up because he spent an extraordinary time doing homework, while his twin sister who shared some classes with him, didn't. He would be up until nearly midnight doing homework. It seemed weird and when I would question him about it, he would just make up odd excuses. I found money in his pockets while doing laundry and since he didn't have a job, that didn't sit right. I asked my younger son if he knew why his brother had money in his pocket and he told me what was up. He was apparently paying his brother and sister as well to keep quiet. After I found out, I told my son that I was going to call his teachers and see why he was being given so much homework. My son immediately told me not to do that, so I told him that I wouldn't call. Instead, the following day when I drove the kids to school, I got out of the car with my son and told him that I wanted to talk to the principal in person. I told my son that his teachers were being absolutely ridiculous and I had to go above them if I wanted anything to be done. My son confessed before we got to the school. *Before anyone says it, I am not the type of parent to go to the principal or teachers over homework. I wasn't actually going to it. Just wanted to frighten my son."
0,Tell your friend I like him.,"So, a bit of backstory first. A few years back (summer after our second year of university) a buddy and I were at a party in a rural university town about an hour outside of the city where we grew up. It was a fairly big party and there were tons of people there, including a few guys my buddy played football against. Everything was going well, it was getting late, and my girlfriend came to pick me up, so I took off. About fifteen minutes later I got the phone call: things had turned ugly after I left, and someone sucker-punched my buddy. The way he fell, he fractured his skull, had to be evac'd by helicopter to the city, where he underwent hours and hours of surgery. The next year or two was a brutal, brutal recovery period. At first they weren't sure if he'd ever be able to play sports again, much less a concussive sport like football. Against all odds, he trained his ass off, and was back on the field a year and a half later, for his fourth year of eligibility. That fourth year, his school (a different rural university town outside of the city) had homecoming. At their homecoming game, they played against the team that rostered the guy who had hit him (let's call him Punchy for clarity's sake.) Anyway, my buddy's team shitstomped Punchy's team all afternoon, and ended up winning by a few touchdowns, with a particularly gifted performance by my buddy. Later in the night, we were at the bar (THE bar, not A bar) drinking like fish and celebrating a big win, and ultimately, his return to being successful at football. Later in the evening, we look up, and who should come swaggering over to the table but Punchy and a couple of his boys. Me and my buddy both stood up, along with one of the D-linemen on his team, ready for whatever. After the usual macho back-and-forth shit-talking between the athletes, Punchy leaned in with a smirk and asked my buddy ""how's your head?"" Without even missing a beat, I swear to God, my buddy took a quick crowhop forward and HEADBUTTED Punchy square in the face. We heard a crack, and Punchy immediately hit the floor and began leaking blood. The rest of the night predictably turned to shit, but before the chaos ensued, my buddy stood over Punchy and replied ""you tell me."" May not be the wittiest comeback I've ever heard of, but it was damn sure the most effective."

0,"I'm sorry you were hit by a car, that is certainly no laughing matter, but... your description of the old lady with a lead foot had me giggling!","The general public... I've always worked with the general public. It's horrible. When I was in college I worked at my stepdad's car wash. The dumbest people are in cars. Here's some of my craziest customers. Some silly things would happen frequently, like there's 3 lanes, but everyone will pile into one lane and fuss if someone else's car was finished before theirs. The only time I've only lost my cool with one these customers. I was helping a customer, and a lady was pulling up behind him instead of pulling into one of the other open lanes. I pointed to direct her on where to go. When I finished helping him, I went to greet her. She flings her door open and starts screaming at me for being rude, and shouting ""Pointing doesn't let me know where to go!"" I say ""I'm sorry ma'am. I was just trying to get you into an empty lane so we can get to your car quicker."" She yells ""You should've walked over here and pointed out the open lane!"" I tell her that I was taking a customer's order and I couldn't walk off, and then I go on to try to take her order. She keeps shouting and insulting me. After five minutes of this I'm done helping, and say ""Okay. I'm not going to walk away from a customer to point at an empty space in the lot because you don't have enough common sense to go there. Someone else will come get your order."" Another man was old and thought that women should only cook and bear children. He was always so nice to the men, but really rude to me. I would give everyone the same speech. ""Just leave your car in park and the keys in the ignition. Give this ticket to the cashier. Thank you, and have a nice day!"" He would respond by shaking his finger in my face and saying ""Don't you fucking tell me what to do!"" We would offer a free exterior rewash if you brought your receipt back within 2 days. This one woman that was the definition of a prude would always come in for her rewash. She would never have her receipt with her. She would always say ""They've never asked for my receipt before."" After about the 9th time I told her ""Ma'am, I am always the one that takes your order. I tell you every single time that you have to bring your receipt back. You have only paid for one wash out of the last 10. You can not have a wash today unless you pay for it."" She gets huffy and purses her lips and says ""Excuse me? Are you accusing me of lying? You know that I make more money than you, right?"" I say ""Oh, you do? Then you shouldn't have a problem buying a $5.00 wash."" When she goes into the wash her car started jumping over the rollers that push your car through. So now her car is stuck in the middle of the wash. We shut it off and she rolls down her window and starts yelling about how we're incompetent and our washing is messing her car up. We tell her to make sure she's in neutral and not touching the brakes or steering wheel. ""I'm not stupid. I know how to go through a car wash."" Her car jumps the rollers again, except this time we're watching and see her brake lights come on as soon as the rollers start moving her. She starts yelling that she wants her money back because we're going to mess up her car. ""Ma'am, we just watched you put your brakes on. If anything, you're going to mess up our wash. You will not be getting a refund."" AANNNDD the best. There was a really really old lady that would come in. She was one of those people that comes to a complete stop before turning her wheel to turn in somewhere. I always knew she was coming in because I could hear people on the street honking at her. I would always meet her car before she got to where she needed to be because I didn't want her to drive anymore. One time she refused to get out and wanted to drive her car through the wash herself. I was standing down the lot and directing her on where to go. She hits the gas, hits me, I flip over the top of her car, land on the concrete, watch her jump the curb(as she hits a shopping cart that flies so fast it sticks in a wooden fence), go into the lot next door and do a donut, and hop back over the curb and crash into the side of our building. We had to share an ambulance. She was 90 years old and her kids weren't keeping her from driving or watching over her. She was holding the gas in the whole time, thinking it was the brake. Out of all that time she didn't think that maybe she's not pressing the brake."

0,"Light be with you, friend.","So long, and thanks for all the fish, Azeroth Let me just start out this post by saying this isn't an average ""I'm quitting"" post as after this, I will not be around for much longer but first of all I want to say thank you Blizzard, thank you for the countless years on this game that have brought me and my family much joy. Second, thank you to the community who make this game what it is today, trolls, toxic ninja looters and nice guy's alike. What's a wow journey without some asshole stealing the trinket you wanted for ages then mass kicking everyone? I'll try not to waffle on too much but I've said it a few times in this subreddit before, my father and brother both played wow. We had a family account we loved to play, my father passed away in 2011 along with my mother later in the year. My brother got the account banned and I made my own in 2012 after months of what I'd like to call hell, my brother was a drug addict after our parents died, we were living in poverty and hounded by debt collectors. Later that year I pulled us over 1000km away from that and we started a life here, but I never got better, WoW was that one outlet for me that really helped me keep stable, helped me stay social even though I left the house less than once a month. Raiding was a huge passion of mine as I couldn't work anymore like I used to and felt I was fulfilling some purpose, after caring for my dying mother for 3 years, I lost the will to live for myself, and have now for the last 5 years, dedicated my life to my brother and getting him better which he slowly is and I feel safe enough now to let him live his life on his own. Thank you for the years of happiness, thank you for the years of keeping me afloat but unfortunately over the last 6 months however, I've been declining in mental and physical health quite rapidly, I was diagnosed with multiple permanent illnesses that have a good chance of getting much worse than they are and i'm showing the signs of others, and I do not want to continue on letting them worsen and I have stopped my medication, I am also at very high risk of what killed my mother (and her father, and my fathers mother, etc) and I do not want to go like they did. I loved this game, and I hope it continues to be made well after I am gone, although I will be spending the next few months setting up for my departure. I am going to log out in my favourite spot, The Secret Aerie pond, looking out into the mountains and the sky in Pandaria for one last time before giving my account to someone I love very dearly, who I have had to say goodbye to in order to save him from hurting. I don't know when the end will come, but its inevitable. Again, thank you for having me Azeroth, dioniss aca From, just your average Draenei Mage."

1,How about just reduce her base AD by 5.,"Camille deserves nerfs - but lets do it right I've spammed the ever loving hell out of camille lately and have just recently hit mastery 7 on her, and I can confirm that she is busted. However I feel like what riot generally ends up doing is just nerfing the base stats or damage of a champ like her until she is effectively gutted. There are less drastic ways to nerf her that will still keep her as a viable pick, but not as oppressive. The main thing with her that makes her hilariously busted in my opinion is her ability to trade for free in lane with little to no counterplay for most opposing toplaners. Unless you are playing jax, poppy, or fiora, camille's lane is almost as abusive as renektons with her also scaling better into the game. The main issue is the q2 prep e-aa-q combo, which can deal an upwards of a third of someones health with absolutely no way to deal with it. So what are the best ways to nerf her? -Increased e cooldown in the early levels by a lot, I feel like a ~20 second cd will keep her ability to trade for free down -Remove attack speed buff on e, its a completely unnecessary stat boost and I'm not quite sure why its there -Make her shield health percentage scale by level, starting at 10% and increasing to 20% These nerfs will serve to bring her back in line without going too far, if she still needs nerfs after that she can get looked at again"

1,Obviously all retail workers are subhumans and should not be allowed to interact with the world outside of their job.,"Saying ""I don't work here"" doesn't mean I've forgotten that I work here. This was a while ago when I was 17 years old. I had just finished my shift at Waitrose (a UK supermarket), my mum picked me up from work and we stopped off at a petrol station on the way home. The petrol station was one of those that were part chain-supermarket - this one was part Marks &amp; Spencers. (For clarification, my uniform was white, with a green tie, and a grey apron with 'WAITROSE' emblazoned on it. The Marks &amp; Spencers uniform is all black. I was also wearing a coat and had my hair down.) I was just browsing waiting for my mum to pay, when a lady came up to me: Lady: ""Where are the nuts?"" Me: ""Oh, really sorry, I don't work here."" (I then pointed to the huge 'WAITROSE' on the front of my apron. ""I'm just still in my work uniform from Waitrose."" Lady: ""...So where are the nuts?"" Me: ""Like I said, don't work here, so I don't know. I'm sorry?"" Lady: ""Excuse me? Where's your supervisor, you're being rude."" Me: ""I wouldn't know, since I don't work here? There's an employee over there, I'm sure they'll know where the nuts are."" The lady then storms over the M&amp;S employee and starts loudly proclaiming that a ""member of their staff"" was being rude to her and refusing to serve her by pretending to not work in the shop. I made eye-contact with the employee and gesture to my 'WAITROSE' apron. The employee explains to the lady that I don't work here. Lady: ""Then why is she PRETENDING to work here?"" Employee: ""She's just doing her shopping, like you were."" Lady: ""That's ridiculous. She needs to leave, she's confusing people. You should ask her to leave."" Employee: ""I'm not going to do that, she has as much right to be here as you."" Lady: ""That's ridiculous, I want to speak to your manager."" At this point I was on my way out anyway, so I didn't hear how the lady was dealt with, but I've never experienced something like that again. tl;dr: told a lady I didn't work in the store, she accuses me of lying and says I shouldn't be allowed in the store because I don't work there."

She stopped what she was saying to mention that I looked really good in the tux. Also, at our opening night party, she asked me to sit with her and her parents. Though I'm not sure if that was because she wanted me to occupy the table with her after her parents left so our other cast members could join us or not. Either way, I tend to psych myself out when she does things that make me think that she may be interested in me. I give myself excuses like ""Oh she probably just meant the compliment in a friendly kind of way and nothing else"" or ""She just needs to me fill space at the table so she's not awkwardly occupying the table by herself"".

1,Because men don't get abused.,"Anyone ever notice how whenever a woman commits domestic violence they don't actually say ""domestic violence"". They say she ""beat up her boyfriend"" or they call it ""assault"".

Anyone know why this is?"
1,Found the Lawful Evil NPC,"Please don't play evil characters or characters who obviously don't fit in with the rest of the party. People who are new to the idea of alignment always equate evil=psycho. An evil person is not always a sadistic lunatic. A lot of the time they don't see themselves as evil at all. They love their mothers and their dog, they make friends, and they do nice things for people. Just because they're willing to commit evil acts doesn't mean they don't follow their own sense of morality. Also, most evil people understand that acting outside of the norm will get them in trouble and they will avoid that attention. The edgy ""evil"" character who murders the helpless prisoner in front of the entire party and then acts ""baffled"" when everyone is offended will not and should not last long. The right kind of evil player would wait until the party is asleep, fake an injury before stabbing the prisoner in the chest, and then convince everyone that they were attacked and the prisoner was trying to escape. Or he would attempt to corrupt the party, convincing them with smooth words why killing the prisoner is the best course of action and offer to do it himself to spare everyone else the deed. So remember kids, evil does not always mean sociopath."

0,"The more fun the toy, the longer the cooldown.","Why are the cooldowns on toys so sporadic and weird? Title. The cooldowns for Toys seem rather arbitrarily implemented, without any concern for what the toy actually does. Gamon's Braid has a 2-hour cooldown, Iron Boot Flask has a 1-hour cooldown. I looked back through previous posts but none of them really seem helpful. ""It ruins the flavor of WoW if you can just spam them constantly."" Makes little sense depending on how long you play. If a *majority* of people play for 5+ hours a day, then alright, I could see limiting the use of Toys. But some of them just have baffling CDs for no real reason. Hell, Moroes' Famous Polish is debatably more ""game-changing"" than either of the above because it shows your character as being as naked as possible, but it only has a 30 minute CD by comparison. Spirit of Bashiok summons the dancing tree that's on fire for like 3-5 minutes, but has an hour CD, whereas Archmage Vargoth's Spare Staff has a 2 minute cooldown and lasts around the same time as far as I'm aware. Even if the items all cause strain on the servers, which I'm sure they do when spammed (Like the Haunted Memento's ghost thing apparently), that doesn't change the inconsistency with regards to the cooldowns. How is the cooldown decided? Orb of Deception lets you change into a member of the Horde for 5 minutes with a 30-minute CD. Iron Boot Flask makes you an Iron Dwarf for 10 minutes with an hour CD. The Bloodmane Charm makes you into a Saberon, with a 30-minute CD too. It's not like all of them are abuseable in some way. Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I just can't wrap my head around it."

In other words, the Champions League might have the behemoths of the game, but the Europa League looks like it's set for a much more fun and interesting tournament. What are your predictions?"

We could have built at least 20 if we wouldn't have given massive tax cuts to the top 1% (the Bush tax cuts). There's really no reason the US couldn't have financed the entire thing. It's small potatoes compared to the bullshit we waste our money on."
