"The thing about Shyvanna is... Vaginas exude a large amount of heat on normal human women, let alone on certain female half-dragons, whose body temperatures would only naturally be much higher than a normal human's. If one were to approach Shyvana's bare vagina, especially if she was aroused, you would probably be able to feel the heat of it on your skin. The natural heat is also probably conducive to arousal in its own right. Much like a 15 year old going through puberty and getting erections at random, a side effect of being a half-breed is probably often, unprovoked arousal. Who knows, it may even be permanent. Shyvana might literally be ""in heat"" at all times. On top of what may be almost perpetual wetness between her thighs, her naturally high body temperature probably makes it difficult for her to wear human clothes comfortably (especially tight, reinforced armor). She probably sweats profusely in her armor, enough to drench herself in only one short outing to Summoner's Rift. But then again she may get off on the feeling of being wrapped so tightly, so to speak. The sensation of her wet vagina would probably resemble putting your finger into a bath of hot honey. The juices more viscous than normal and just hot enough that you almost risk a burn. Imagine the smell and the taste of her inner thighs after one match. Wet and sticky with a musky odor and all salty-sweet from the combination of her various juices. [SEP] What the fuck just happened here",0

"Saying ""I don't work here"" doesn't mean I've forgotten that I work here. This was a while ago when I was 17 years old. I had just finished my shift at Waitrose (a UK supermarket), my mum picked me up from work and we stopped off at a petrol station on the way home. The petrol station was one of those that were part chain-supermarket - this one was part Marks &amp; Spencers. (For clarification, my uniform was white, with a green tie, and a grey apron with 'WAITROSE' emblazoned on it. The Marks &amp; Spencers uniform is all black. I was also wearing a coat and had my hair down.) I was just browsing waiting for my mum to pay, when a lady came up to me: Lady: ""Where are the nuts?"" Me: ""Oh, really sorry, I don't work here."" (I then pointed to the huge 'WAITROSE' on the front of my apron. ""I'm just still in my work uniform from Waitrose."" Lady: ""...So where are the nuts?"" Me: ""Like I said, don't work here, so I don't know. I'm sorry?"" Lady: ""Excuse me? Where's your supervisor, you're being rude."" Me: ""I wouldn't know, since I don't work here? There's an employee over there, I'm sure they'll know where the nuts are."" The lady then storms over the M&amp;S employee and starts loudly proclaiming that a ""member of their staff"" was being rude to her and refusing to serve her by pretending to not work in the shop. I made eye-contact with the employee and gesture to my 'WAITROSE' apron. The employee explains to the lady that I don't work here. Lady: ""Then why is she PRETENDING to work here?"" Employee: ""She's just doing her shopping, like you were."" Lady: ""That's ridiculous. She needs to leave, she's confusing people. You should ask her to leave."" Employee: ""I'm not going to do that, she has as much right to be here as you."" Lady: ""That's ridiculous, I want to speak to your manager."" At this point I was on my way out anyway, so I didn't hear how the lady was dealt with, but I've never experienced something like that again. tl;dr: told a lady I didn't work in the store, she accuses me of lying and says I shouldn't be allowed in the store because I don't work there.

"My friends (19,20M) just humiliated me (19M) with a cruel joke and I'm questioning if they're really my friends. Hey, this just happened so I apologise in advance if I come off as a bit salty/upset. For some context, I'm living out of home and am in my first year of university; scraping by and working my arse off. I make ends meet and I have a modest income, but not really any expendable income; and sometimes find myself with no money available to me at all; but with no outstanding costs until my next pay check. (I can't go on benefits because my parents' income is too high, yet they won't offer financial assistance themselves. Not really relevant but just setting the scene). My friend, let's call him T, however is a professional soccer player, and has a 60k+ income that he will often throw on roulette or something like that. He's an old friend of mine from when we were 6, and I see him semi-regularly. My other friend, C; is just average. Both live at home and thus have expendable incomes (especially in the case of T). T invited me around this evening for some video games and kicking back, which I was keen for; seeing as it was catching up yet with no cost attached. When I'm about to leave; he texts me and says that there's been a change of plan; that we're going out for dinner at this semi-expensive restaurant and that he'd love for me to come. I initially decline, saying that I can't afford it and that I'd catch up with them after. However; he begins to go ""oh, but C has trekked it all the way from X"" and insists that I come along; saying that he's shouting (paying for) the feed anyway. After he pesters me some more, I cave and say I'll be there. The dinner goes pretty well! Some banter, good food, and overall I thought it was a good time. That was until we got to the end of the meal. T suddenly looks panicked and looks in his wallet. ""Oh shit, I don't have my card with me"". He then goes on to show me that he's got enough in cash to pay for his section of the meal, and C has enough to pay for his, but then begins to laugh at me and begin giggling at my expense because ""you're up shit creek mate, too poor to pay for your own meal"". Then goes on to laugh about the fact that I'll either have to dine and dash (which I'm not comfortable with and honestly would never do) or that I'm straight up fucked. The whole time I'm trying to kind of laugh it off as banter but as he persists with his insistence that he doesn't have enough to pay for me; I get more and more uncomfortable and pretty upset. He then begins to jokingly call the waiter over for the check, and says that there's an issue. I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to try and get some fresh air and maybe try and work out what the fuck is going on; and when I return they've paid for their individual shares, and have apparently told the waiter that I can't pay for mine. Manager comes up and says he'll have to call the police, all while my friends have walked out of the restaurant. Just before he rings, however; my friend comes back and says he'll pay for me, and that he has to bail me out ONCE AGAIN (I've never taken a cent of his money before, I make a point of being self sufficient and not taking bail outs.) So after I was humiliated at a restaurant I actually quite like and sometimes go to with my family (and that I can never go to again); T begins to just spend the rest of the time laughing at my expense and about how great that display of ""banter"" was. I'm pretty fucking steamed so I just kind of walk off and haven't replied to his texts. Banter is one thing, but public humiliation like that... It just seems a bit much. Am I overreacting and need to get some thicker skin? Was I just an idiot to think my loaded friend just wanted to be generous, or should I have seen it coming? This isn't the first joke at my expense and sadly I don't think it'll be the last. Tl;dr - my rich friends publicly humiliated me for being broke, pls read the main text.

I could have taken him to the vet, but he hates the vet, so thought I'd give it a bash myself. I prepped with gloves, put him in the bath, but forgot the whole cover his arsehole with toilet paper part. He was surprisingly docile during it, mildly curious but that's about it. At first I couldn't find the glands, so I was pretty much just milking his arsehole, but then I found those little pea sized balls of fury. It was like Psycho or something, anal gland juice sprayed all up the walls and everything. Holy mackeral does that stuff smell bad! I vaguely knew, from his leaky butt earlier, but it was nothing compared this crime scene. My dog immediately turned around and started trying to lick it all up, to hide his shame, I imagine, but I managed to stop him before he got through too much of it.

If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich.

"Reminds me of a time I got a ticket from a state trooper. I was lazy and missed the date to pay the fine so I had to go to court to pay it. I decided since I was there to see if there were any loop holes I could use to get out of it. A bit of googling and I found out the cop who wrote the ticket has to be there in order to testify you were in fact speeding. She wasn't. So, there I sit waiting for my turn hoping she doesn't get there before its my turn. I strike up a convo with another guy there. He got a speeding ticket for speeding trying to get his daughter to a hospital. I tell him what I've found and to try it that way. He doesn't listen, and tries the ""I'm guilty but I have a good excuse."" He gets fined and points against his record. Finally, I'm the last one to get in front of the judge. Still no cop to be seen. So, I ask for the case to be dismissed because the state can't provide a witness against me. The judge grins and talks to me a bit about football, as it is the fall in the south, and then dismisses the ticket. So, the moral of the story here is if you get a speeding ticket, do your due diligence on how to get out of it.

"You WILL use this card. Hello TFR! Long time lurker, first time poster. I work retail at a store that's fairly large so it has a lot of rules. One such rule is that we need to check people's cards to see if there is a signature. If not, we need to see an i.d. with a name that matches the card. Since it's the holidays, we have been strictly enforcing this rule since there have been reports around our mall about people using stolen cards. Even if someone is using their spouses card and has the same last name, we can't use it because they could have stolen their card and gone on a crazy shopping spree because they are mad at them or seperated or for whatever crazy person reason. I had to use this rule on one lady tonight who just didn't seem to get it. M = Me, RL = Rude Lady M: *finishing the transaction when I notice there's no signature on her card* ""Can I also see an i.d. please?"" RL: *Shows i.d. that has the same last name but a different first name* M: ""I actually need to see an i.d. that has the same first name and last name as the card"". RL: ""That's my husbands card"". M: ""Unfortunately he does need to be present since it's his card and I do need to see his i.d. to complete the transaction"". RL: *in the most condescending tone you could image* "" He isn't here but you WILL be using this card"". M: ""Unfortunately our policy is that we need to see an i.d. that matches the card."" RL: ""I am not coming back to this store later so I WILL be using this card."" M: ""I'm sorry but I can't continue without your husband present"". RL: ""No, you WILL be using this card."" And that went on for another minute. She kept emphasizing ""will"" so much it was like she was trying to use the jedi mind trick on me. I wanted to shout "" You WILL be LEAVING THE STORE NOW"". The manager was called and approved the transaction since the lady had the same last name and my manager didn't know how rude she had been. Next time someone is that rude to me I'll just say ""sorry, your card doesn't have a signature and is therefore invalid. That is technically credit card fraud. Bye!"". [SEP] I just do not understand why managers do this They tell us not since we are enforcing their rules but I guess they do not apply to them",0

"Oysters When me and my best friend were 16 we went travelling in Ireland. He's Irish and has family in Ireland who were keeping an eye on us, so we weren't really on our own. Nonetheless it was our first glimpse of independence, even if we were peering at it through the protective arms of his family. Anyway, one night we decided to try and get served at a bar. We went in, my friend walked confidently up to the bar and asked for two pints. The bartender knew we were underage, after all how could anybody not. Nonetheless with a knowing look and a smile he poured us a pint each. About half way through this first pint a group of men walked into the bar and the whole atmosphere changed. It was clear these men were highly respected within this community. We decided to sidle on up to them and start a conversation. They took a liking to us and started buying us drinks. My memory fades rather abruptly at this point, next thing I remember is waking up on a boat. It turns out these men worked on a trawler. We got far to drunk and the men didn't know what to do with us, so they took us out on their boat for the day. Me and my friend tried to make our selves useful, but it was clear we had no idea what we were doing, much to the amusement of the trawler-men. Suddenly a quiet fear settled over the boat. We were heading right for a storm, and the captain, a haggard seaman of many years was scared. Told us later it was the worst storm he'd ever seen. Sure enough a wave came crashing into the side of the boat. We gathered ourselves up and looked around and my friend was nowhere to be seen. He'd been washed overboard by the wave. The captain flew out of his cabin, quickly tying a rope around his waste he dove into the water. There was a moments calm as everyone anxiously waited. A few bubbles floated to the surface. Then we a triumphant splash both captain and friend surfaced. The rest of the crewe dragged them both back on board. Without saying a word, the captain walks over to a pile of oysters and with a flick of his knife opens one up and hands it to the nearest man. It's clear what he is doing, we survived and we are toasting that fact. Since we don't have beer an oyster shall have to suffice. We raised our oysters and downed them in unison and they just weren't for me really... [SEP] Was expecting tree fiddy...",0

"Somewhat related: I used to get picked on and beaten up as a kid for being white, but I didn't know that was the reason. Complete strangers, typically young teens, while I was about 10, but strangers nonetheless would hurt me, physically and verbally. I thought ""white boy"" was just a descriptor, even when preceding or following a beat down, not a slur. I just believed I was a piece of shit. Why else would people I don't know hurt me? But it was an attitude that was reinforced, literally beaten into me at times, and it became fact for me. Part of learning to love myself was reinforcing the opposite. Telling myself, out loud, especially look at myself in the mirror, that I'm a good, worthwhile person. Repetition of positives or negatives as beliefs can be incredibly powerful.
