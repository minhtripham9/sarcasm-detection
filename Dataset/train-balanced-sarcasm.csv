I have had several awkward tinder dates. the worst was this guy who was 23 and had pretty much grown up on the computer. usually don't mind guys having a gaming hobby. any hobby is great as it shows you have a passion for something. but it should be a hobby it shouldn't rule your life. anyway I offered to meet him at the uni we both attended to grab a coffee, but he insisted on going to the local shopping complex despite the fact that he didn't drive. no idea how he got there. he ended up being around 30 mins late. ok. I can deal with that. when we finally meet he's so nervous he's shaking like a Chihuahua. and barely able to speak. I get it. first dates can be nerve-wracking. we sit down to sushi and there is absolute dead silence. I start asking him questions to start the conversation but all I get is 2 word replies...right. this is getting a bit more frustrating.I even ask him questions about what games he likes (I do know a bit about games) but all I get is condescending answers. i'm starting to feel more like an interrogator than a date. suddenly he perks up and goes ""uhh...I have to go. there's a LAN party on"" ok mate. you're not feeling comfortable on this date thats fine. even though you suggested it and you were so confident online. so we part ways. the kicker comes about 4:30am the next morning. i'm working an overnight shift at Maccas and this group of guys come in. Chihuahua boy is in the group, being a whole lot more confident (I get it, it's easier being social with friends). they walk in talking about ""bitches"" and how ""fucking fake gamer bitches"" ruined their Lan Party (I wish I was making this up) he goes to order. and doesn't realise it's me. they leave a huge mess behind (i'm talking purposely smearing ice cream on the table and chairs plus more) because it's the employees job to clean up. the next afternoon i get a message from him asking if i'd like to meet up with him again. I politely said no. He called me a fat bitch. never saw him again."

0,You need new friends.,relationships,3766,02/06/2016 11:25,"My friends (19,20M) just humiliated me (19M) with a cruel joke and I'm questioning if they're really my friends. Hey, this just happened so I apologise in advance if I come off as a bit salty/upset. For some context, I'm living out of home and am in my first year of university; scraping by and working my arse off. I make ends meet and I have a modest income, but not really any expendable income; and sometimes find myself with no money available to me at all; but with no outstanding costs until my next pay check. (I can't go on benefits because my parents' income is too high, yet they won't offer financial assistance themselves. Not really relevant but just setting the scene). My friend, let's call him T, however is a professional soccer player, and has a 60k+ income that he will often throw on roulette or something like that. He's an old friend of mine from when we were 6, and I see him semi-regularly. My other friend, C; is just average. Both live at home and thus have expendable incomes (especially in the case of T). T invited me around this evening for some video games and kicking back, which I was keen for; seeing as it was catching up yet with no cost attached. When I'm about to leave; he texts me and says that there's been a change of plan; that we're going out for dinner at this semi-expensive restaurant and that he'd love for me to come. I initially decline, saying that I can't afford it and that I'd catch up with them after. However; he begins to go ""oh, but C has trekked it all the way from X"" and insists that I come along; saying that he's shouting (paying for) the feed anyway. After he pesters me some more, I cave and say I'll be there. The dinner goes pretty well! Some banter, good food, and overall I thought it was a good time. That was until we got to the end of the meal. T suddenly looks panicked and looks in his wallet. ""Oh shit, I don't have my card with me"". He then goes on to show me that he's got enough in cash to pay for his section of the meal, and C has enough to pay for his, but then begins to laugh at me and begin giggling at my expense because ""you're up shit creek mate, too poor to pay for your own meal"". Then goes on to laugh about the fact that I'll either have to dine and dash (which I'm not comfortable with and honestly would never do) or that I'm straight up fucked. The whole time I'm trying to kind of laugh it off as banter but as he persists with his insistence that he doesn't have enough to pay for me; I get more and more uncomfortable and pretty upset. He then begins to jokingly call the waiter over for the check, and says that there's an issue. I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to try and get some fresh air and maybe try and work out what the fuck is going on; and when I return they've paid for their individual shares, and have apparently told the waiter that I can't pay for mine. Manager comes up and says he'll have to call the police, all while my friends have walked out of the restaurant. Just before he rings, however; my friend comes back and says he'll pay for me, and that he has to bail me out ONCE AGAIN (I've never taken a cent of his money before, I make a point of being self sufficient and not taking bail outs.) So after I was humiliated at a restaurant I actually quite like and sometimes go to with my family (and that I can never go to again); T begins to just spend the rest of the time laughing at my expense and about how great that display of ""banter"" was. I'm pretty fucking steamed so I just kind of walk off and haven't replied to his texts. Banter is one thing, but public humiliation like that... It just seems a bit much. Am I overreacting and need to get some thicker skin? Was I just an idiot to think my loaded friend just wanted to be generous, or should I have seen it coming? This isn't the first joke at my expense and sadly I don't think it'll be the last. Tl;dr - my rich friends publicly humiliated me for being broke, pls read the main text."

They had to do a music video and switch the lyrics of a song to have it be science related, so they chose Survivor's ""The Eye of the Tiger"" and turned it into ""The Bones of our Body"". Everybody came to our house and we shot the music video in one shot in our garage. One of the teammates was this REALLY quiet kid, but still made the effort to sing along. When everybody's parents came to pick them up, Shy Guy's mother INSISTED on watching the video. It wasn't ready of course, I still had to edit it. But nope! She ended up seeing the whole thing damn thing through the camcorder screen...and she didn't like it. She told me to film it again and to make sure Shy Guy came out more (when some of the teammates left already!). So everybody had to return to our house and film again because of a crazy lady. Oh yeah! And she stood behind the camera to make SURE that Shy Guy came out. WTF! She was a known psycho, so we figured it was best to do it again to shut her up."

""To enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal."""

Vaginas exude a large amount of heat on normal human women, let alone on certain female half-dragons, whose body temperatures would only naturally be much higher than a normal human's. If one were to approach Shyvana's bare vagina, especially if she was aroused, you would probably be able to feel the heat of it on your skin. The natural heat is also probably conducive to arousal in its own right. Much like a 15 year old going through puberty and getting erections at random, a side effect of being a half-breed is probably often, unprovoked arousal. Who knows, it may even be permanent. Shyvana might literally be ""in heat"" at all times. On top of what may be almost perpetual wetness between her thighs, her naturally high body temperature probably makes it difficult for her to wear human clothes comfortably (especially tight, reinforced armor). She probably sweats profusely in her armor, enough to drench herself in only one short outing to Summoner's Rift. But then again she may get off on the feeling of being wrapped so tightly, so to speak. The sensation of her wet vagina would probably resemble putting your finger into a bath of hot honey. The juices more viscous than normal and just hot enough that you almost risk a burn. Imagine the smell and the taste of her inner thighs after one match. Wet and sticky with a musky odor and all salty-sweet from the combination of her various juices."

Actually, the other wife - I'll call her Jessica - she and I have talked several times and even got together for coffee after I called her about it. I apologized profusely for ""putting her through this"", even though I was just the bearer of bad news. Part of me wanted to spare her that pain from her even knowing, you know? At first she was very upset, crying and then got angry - first at him then herself. She quickly came to realize that it wasn't her fault. And the fact that I've known her brother for so many years probably helped. They know me well enough. Last night she asked me to meet her again for lunch tomorrow or Monday because we are going through the same thing.

A bit of googling and I found out the cop who wrote the ticket has to be there in order to testify you were in fact speeding. She wasn't. So, there I sit waiting for my turn hoping she doesn't get there before its my turn. I strike up a convo with another guy there. He got a speeding ticket for speeding trying to get his daughter to a hospital. I tell him what I've found and to try it that way. He doesn't listen, and tries the ""I'm guilty but I have a good excuse."" He gets fined and points against his record. Finally, I'm the last one to get in front of the judge. Still no cop to be seen. So, I ask for the case to be dismissed because the state can't provide a witness against me. The judge grins and talks to me a bit about football, as it is the fall in the south, and then dismisses the ticket. So, the moral of the story here is if you get a speeding ticket, do your due diligence on how to get out of it."

I was actually recommend it by a family friend. So I live in Pennsylvania and I just completed my Sophomore year. I was super excited to be on summer break and just relax over the summer. My friends had organised this party last night to celebrate and just have a good time. I normally dress really smart just in general because I care about my appearance. Yesterday morning at around 11 am I got a phone call from my friend that was hosting the party. I answered my phone and he goes "" Bro, you need to find a date"". I was confused as holy hell as to why, so I did the natural thing and asked him. He said "" Bro, I and Sasha (girlfriend) have made the party couples only. You need to find a date or you can't come."" Before I even had a chance to respond he hang up on me. So I sat in my room thinking Christ, where am I going to find a date. All the girls I know really well are in relationships and who is going to want to go on a date now on such short notice. So I sent him a text telling him this and he said "" Sorry bro, you can't come then"". I had 7 hours to find a date. If you can find a date in 7 hours more power to you, but to me that sounds like an impossible task. I decided fuck it, I don't need this I am going to go out by myself. I went down to the mall. The mall near my place has this outside part to it. It is mainly restaurants and stuff but they stay open way after the mall closes. I hanged around there and there was a local band so I just listened to them. But the whole night it was bugging me that 7 hours before the party they told me this.

0,Don't care if it's true... this deserves to be higher.,AskReddit,417,29/03/2016 20:04,"I've had just the opposite. I was the custodian. (Cleaning man?) When I was in college, every winter break I would go to the temp agency and they would place you in all types of temporary jobs. Some were temporary construction where you'd only go in for a day. Some you have for weeks or the entire month break because they needed someone immediately and couldn't find a full time replacement. Anyway, this one winter I was given a custodial job in an office park, basically emptying trash and doing minor cleanups in each office. It was great because I didn't start until 530ish and could finish by 930 or 10 and go out for the night and then sleep in. Generally I didn't run into any people, as most people were gone for the night. But in one office for the first 3 nights of work I notice this beautiful lady, probably in her mid to late 30s, all alone, deep into her spreadsheets at 8pm. At first I would just knock, apologize for bothering her, change out her garbage, and wish her a good night. After I noticed her being in the office late every night I would walk in, crack some corny jokes, comment on the pictures she displayed in her office, and lamely tried to flirt, fumbling through my words. I suppose this became endearing and by the end of the second week she would seem to be relieved to see me, offering her a chance to take a break and relax for a moment. One day as I'm reaching for her garbage pail, she grabbed my biceps and said ""not too bad"" and laughed. I laughed and shook my head, thinking she was just messing with me (I'm very normal/average build) but couldn't help imagining in my 20 year old brain that this possible meaned something. The next night, she's the only person in the office again at 8 and she's dressed like it's straight out of a porno in an office setting. Tight pencil skirt, heels, a tight button down blouse, and glasses (which she didn't wear every night). I decided that after yesterday I was okay to shoot my shot so I commented that her outfit was really working for her. She smiled at me and unbuttoned one more button and asked ""does it look better like this? Or that"" as she re-buttoned the button. Without missing a beat, I replied ""did you try unbuttoning 2 more buttons?"". For some reason this makes her crack up and she stands up, approaches me, and slaps me on the chest...but then she unbuttons 2 more buttons, gets closer, and starts rubbing my chest then starts to kiss me then pulls back. She then pushes me and tells me to sit her chair. She unbuttons her shirt completely, revealing her bra, and proceeds to get on her knees and unbuckle my pants. She blows me for maybe 90 seconds total and my head is spinning and I'm done. Then she looked up at me and laughed, buttoned her self back up and said ""go on and get out of here"". I got to the bar that night and my friends drinks were on me. The next night when I walked in, I say my hello, and she proceeds to direct me steP by step exactly what I needed to do and exactly how I was going to fuck her. The first night she told me she was going to bend over the the desk, the next night she explained that she would be laying with her back on the desk and I would be finishing on her chest, the night after that she told me to sit in her chair and she would ride me. Every night for those next two weeks was slightly different but with her directing every single aspect of it. To be honest I had never experienced anything like that and it was hot as hell. For those 20 mins each night, she was completely in control of everything and it really got her off. I let her know when it was my last day and that I would be driving back to college the next afternoon. She told to pick her up on her lunch break and she blew me while I drive around town before dropping her off. I can't say any experiences that next semester in college lived up to it. We did not stay in contact after that."

I work for a lesser-known store that sells anything from furniture to food to nifty little trinkets. We close at 9p Mon-Sat, and 7p on Sun. As many retail store workers can understand, lots of customers don't pay attention these hours. Apologies for any formatting issues, as I'm on mobile. The other day, Saturday, I was working the cash register. My basic duties include ringing people up, answering questions, greeting, etc. We close at 9p, just to reiterate. So I'm greeting, and some people walk up to ask me questions about where a particular rug is, what chairs might go with it, stuff like that. I answer what I can and then offer to call someone over to the rug section. They then ask, ""what time do you close again?"" Me: ""oh, 9o'clock tonight."" Looked at the clock, it was a bit before 7 I believe. Them: ""oh that's terrible! That's way too early. How are we supposed to shop and get out in time?"" I asked her if she was shopping for someone or herself, and segued the conversation into our holiday hours. Idk it just rubbed me the wrong way. Like, god forbid I get home to my family at a time that's inconvenient for you. Sorry?"

Once you're in, curve your finger to the direction of your dick and you'll feel your prostate pretty easily considering it feels different as opposed to the rest of the chamber. Even have a go at it jerking off and it'll make your orgasm way more intense. In regards to poop, always do it after you evacuate and if your poop is on the runny side avoid all contact back there. It may smell so when you take your finger out, wash it, lube it, and go back in there soldier (if your healthy, the smell will eventually disappear and you'll be all clean inside).

I prepped with gloves, put him in the bath, but forgot the whole cover his arsehole with toilet paper part. He was surprisingly docile during it, mildly curious but that's about it. At first I couldn't find the glands, so I was pretty much just milking his arsehole, but then I found those little pea sized balls of fury. It was like Psycho or something, anal gland juice sprayed all up the walls and everything. Holy mackeral does that stuff smell bad! I vaguely knew, from his leaky butt earlier, but it was nothing compared this crime scene. My dog immediately turned around and started trying to lick it all up, to hide his shame, I imagine, but I managed to stop him before he got through too much of it.

Actually, even while working/doing homework, I listen to smash bros music or interviews, like old interviews from top players at past tournaments. In fact, as I'm typing this, I am listening to a PPMD interview from 2014. While I'm eating dinner/breakfast, I am simultaneously watching or listening to something related to smash. I even sometimes make little fantasies in my head about what would happen if I went back in time to 2005 or other time periods with the skill I have now and I imagine myself dominating. (I'm a decent sheik/falco player, but I would be incredible in 2005). I find myself watching the same interviews twice. Whenever I don't have anything to watch, I find some random tournament that I haven't seen yet or I rewatch sets. I've probably watched the Mew2king vs Leffen 6-0 like 30 times.

As the moon orbits the earth, this distortion of the earth is manifest in the rise and fall of the tides. There is a similar effect caused by the tug of the sun on the earth, though to a lesser extent. However, when the two forces line up, you get the spring tide (highest of the high tides) which occurs during the Full moon. It makes sense, when you understand that a full moon gets its ""full"" light from the sun being on the (nearly) the direct opposite side of the earth. Man kind has understood this for centuries.

I admit it was because I didn't do the things that showed I was committed. I see why she had to go. Towards the end I thought I wanted to break up too. But I see now how incredibly stupid that was. I won't go into details. I love that girl so much. I've been out with new women, spent time with friends, hit the gym almost every day, been working on changing careers. But the thoughts of her are eating me alive guys. I've never experienced anything this difficult in my life. That girl is my world and I wasn't able to then give her what she deserved, or at least I thought I wasn't. I had some issues I should have addressed earlier on but I didn't know how to. I don't have a very good support group; very fragmented family and friends that aren't the best with real ""life stuff"". So I was juggling too much. Anyway, I just think that this is starting to get unhealthy. I'm doing healthy things like I should be, but nothing works.

When I play games, I like to choose female characters. Especially when you have to create your own characters. It's just more fun o play as a female character. I don't feel the need to ""relate"" to my avatar, I enjoy the fantasy aspect of it just being fantasy and nothing to do with real life. My friends used to make fun of me in the beginning with games like World of Warcraft many years ago. It didn't bother me one bit cause that's how we all treat each other, we make fun of each other and tease each other and it was all fun and good. However, with the recent Pokemon GO app things have turned weird. I picked a female avatar like I always do and some of my friends who usually don't play games started playing as well. They found it weird that I had a female avatar. Some of them started asking me intimate questions like ""are you feeling okay with your gender?"" or do you have any problems that you are too ashamed to mention? They all refer to my avatar and how strange it is. I keep denying it but they never believe me. What can I tell them? **TL;DR**: I like having female avatars in video games. People don't get it and thing I want to change my gender or question my sexuality."

Hello TFR! Long time lurker, first time poster. I work retail at a store that's fairly large so it has a lot of rules. One such rule is that we need to check people's cards to see if there is a signature. If not, we need to see an i.d. with a name that matches the card. Since it's the holidays, we have been strictly enforcing this rule since there have been reports around our mall about people using stolen cards. Even if someone is using their spouses card and has the same last name, we can't use it because they could have stolen their card and gone on a crazy shopping spree because they are mad at them or seperated or for whatever crazy person reason. I had to use this rule on one lady tonight who just didn't seem to get it. M = Me, RL = Rude Lady M: *finishing the transaction when I notice there's no signature on her card* ""Can I also see an i.d. please?"" RL: *Shows i.d. that has the same last name but a different first name* M: ""I actually need to see an i.d. that has the same first name and last name as the card"". RL: ""That's my husbands card"". M: ""Unfortunately he does need to be present since it's his card and I do need to see his i.d. to complete the transaction"". RL: *in the most condescending tone you could image* "" He isn't here but you WILL be using this card"". M: ""Unfortunately our policy is that we need to see an i.d. that matches the card."" RL: ""I am not coming back to this store later so I WILL be using this card."" M: ""I'm sorry but I can't continue without your husband present"". RL: ""No, you WILL be using this card."" And that went on for another minute. She kept emphasizing ""will"" so much it was like she was trying to use the jedi mind trick on me. I wanted to shout "" You WILL be LEAVING THE STORE NOW"". The manager was called and approved the transaction since the lady had the same last name and my manager didn't know how rude she had been. Next time someone is that rude to me I'll just say ""sorry, your card doesn't have a signature and is therefore invalid. That is technically credit card fraud. Bye!""."

Altogether we've been a couple for around 5 years. Let me start off by saying that I do love my wife and our soon-to-be son a lot. They are certainly 2 of the most important people in my life, but they are or were not the person I loved most. That was and always will be my grandfather for a host of different reasons. I think it should suffice to say that he raised me and did so many things to help me become the person I am today. Without him, I would be nothing, and that is why he holds such a special place in my life. I said as much at his funeral a few weeks back, and I'm not sorry for what I said. I could have understated things or chosen different words, but that is how I feel. To say or pretend otherwise would be a lie, and it's not like it's ever been a secret where my grandfather ranked in my life. I'm just not sure what my wife wants or expects of me. I can't change how I feel about my grandfather, but just because he was the person I cared for the most doesn't mean I don't deeply and truly love her or our future son. I know that it's disappointing for her to hear that I don't love her above everyone else, but I can't change that. The bottom line is, she wants me to take back what I said and apologize, but I don't feel like I did anything wrong. I'm not trying to be mean, but I don't know how she can ask that of me given how much he meant to me. I would be nothing without him, but without her I would still have a nice life. The two aren't comparable in any way. I would like to just move on and focus on preparing for our son's birth, but she can't seem to get past this. On the other hand, I can't bring myself to take back what I said, and it makes me angry that she's behaving like a child at such a bad time. We're at a huge impasse, and I don't know how to get us past this. Help/advice would be appreciated. --- **tl;dr**: Said in a eulogy for my grandfather that he was the most important person in my life. Wife got upset because she and our unborn son are not #1 in my world and now wants me to take it back and apologize. I refuse to do so since it is true and I can't help how I feel, not to mention my grandfather did far more for me than she or anyone else ever has, and she can't get past this. Don't know what to do."

He's Irish and has family in Ireland who were keeping an eye on us, so we weren't really on our own. Nonetheless it was our first glimpse of independence, even if we were peering at it through the protective arms of his family. Anyway, one night we decided to try and get served at a bar. We went in, my friend walked confidently up to the bar and asked for two pints. The bartender knew we were underage, after all how could anybody not. Nonetheless with a knowing look and a smile he poured us a pint each. About half way through this first pint a group of men walked into the bar and the whole atmosphere changed. It was clear these men were highly respected within this community. We decided to sidle on up to them and start a conversation. They took a liking to us and started buying us drinks. My memory fades rather abruptly at this point, next thing I remember is waking up on a boat. It turns out these men worked on a trawler. We got far to drunk and the men didn't know what to do with us, so they took us out on their boat for the day. Me and my friend tried to make our selves useful, but it was clear we had no idea what we were doing, much to the amusement of the trawler-men. Suddenly a quiet fear settled over the boat. We were heading right for a storm, and the captain, a haggard seaman of many years was scared. Told us later it was the worst storm he'd ever seen. Sure enough a wave came crashing into the side of the boat. We gathered ourselves up and looked around and my friend was nowhere to be seen. He'd been washed overboard by the wave. The captain flew out of his cabin, quickly tying a rope around his waste he dove into the water. There was a moments calm as everyone anxiously waited. A few bubbles floated to the surface. Then we a triumphant splash both captain and friend surfaced. The rest of the crewe dragged them both back on board. Without saying a word, the captain walks over to a pile of oysters and with a flick of his knife opens one up and hands it to the nearest man. It's clear what he is doing, we survived and we are toasting that fact. Since we don't have beer an oyster shall have to suffice. We raised our oysters and downed them in unison and they just weren't for me really..."

Quantum computers are extremely complex machines that use entanglement and superposition to allow for computing on a higher level than classical machines. Black holes are a giant mess of chaos that erases all information. Bose-Einstein condensates are a state of matter in which all particles share the same ""quantum wave"", which means that they behave in a very synchronous way. These are three very different things that you cannot simply throw together in a sentence and pray for it to sound intelligent. It doesn't! Bose-Einstein condensates can be used to simulate some aspects of black holes using sound, which is amazing. We call it *sonic black holes* and they are widely studied by the complex systems / condensed matter community. You create sound perturbations that can't escape from a fluid that is flowing more quickly than the local speed of sound, which effectively traps the sound like black holes trap light. There are many common properties between black holes and sonic black holes, it's fascinating. But I am not sure this is what your friend was thinking, though."

I knew something was up because he spent an extraordinary time doing homework, while his twin sister who shared some classes with him, didn't. He would be up until nearly midnight doing homework. It seemed weird and when I would question him about it, he would just make up odd excuses. I found money in his pockets while doing laundry and since he didn't have a job, that didn't sit right. I asked my younger son if he knew why his brother had money in his pocket and he told me what was up. He was apparently paying his brother and sister as well to keep quiet. After I found out, I told my son that I was going to call his teachers and see why he was being given so much homework. My son immediately told me not to do that, so I told him that I wouldn't call. Instead, the following day when I drove the kids to school, I got out of the car with my son and told him that I wanted to talk to the principal in person. I told my son that his teachers were being absolutely ridiculous and I had to go above them if I wanted anything to be done. My son confessed before we got to the school. *Before anyone says it, I am not the type of parent to go to the principal or teachers over homework. I wasn't actually going to it. Just wanted to frighten my son."
0,Tell your friend I like him.,AskReddit,239,08/07/2016 19:07,"So, a bit of backstory first. A few years back (summer after our second year of university) a buddy and I were at a party in a rural university town about an hour outside of the city where we grew up. It was a fairly big party and there were tons of people there, including a few guys my buddy played football against. Everything was going well, it was getting late, and my girlfriend came to pick me up, so I took off. About fifteen minutes later I got the phone call: things had turned ugly after I left, and someone sucker-punched my buddy. The way he fell, he fractured his skull, had to be evac'd by helicopter to the city, where he underwent hours and hours of surgery. The next year or two was a brutal, brutal recovery period. At first they weren't sure if he'd ever be able to play sports again, much less a concussive sport like football. Against all odds, he trained his ass off, and was back on the field a year and a half later, for his fourth year of eligibility. That fourth year, his school (a different rural university town outside of the city) had homecoming. At their homecoming game, they played against the team that rostered the guy who had hit him (let's call him Punchy for clarity's sake.) Anyway, my buddy's team shitstomped Punchy's team all afternoon, and ended up winning by a few touchdowns, with a particularly gifted performance by my buddy. Later in the night, we were at the bar (THE bar, not A bar) drinking like fish and celebrating a big win, and ultimately, his return to being successful at football. Later in the evening, we look up, and who should come swaggering over to the table but Punchy and a couple of his boys. Me and my buddy both stood up, along with one of the D-linemen on his team, ready for whatever. After the usual macho back-and-forth shit-talking between the athletes, Punchy leaned in with a smirk and asked my buddy ""how's your head?"" Without even missing a beat, I swear to God, my buddy took a quick crowhop forward and HEADBUTTED Punchy square in the face. We heard a crack, and Punchy immediately hit the floor and began leaking blood. The rest of the night predictably turned to shit, but before the chaos ensued, my buddy stood over Punchy and replied ""you tell me."" May not be the wittiest comeback I've ever heard of, but it was damn sure the most effective."

I've always worked with the general public. It's horrible. When I was in college I worked at my stepdad's car wash. The dumbest people are in cars. Here's some of my craziest customers. Some silly things would happen frequently, like there's 3 lanes, but everyone will pile into one lane and fuss if someone else's car was finished before theirs. The only time I've only lost my cool with one these customers. I was helping a customer, and a lady was pulling up behind him instead of pulling into one of the other open lanes. I pointed to direct her on where to go. When I finished helping him, I went to greet her. She flings her door open and starts screaming at me for being rude, and shouting ""Pointing doesn't let me know where to go!"" I say ""I'm sorry ma'am. I was just trying to get you into an empty lane so we can get to your car quicker."" She yells ""You should've walked over here and pointed out the open lane!"" I tell her that I was taking a customer's order and I couldn't walk off, and then I go on to try to take her order. She keeps shouting and insulting me. After five minutes of this I'm done helping, and say ""Okay. I'm not going to walk away from a customer to point at an empty space in the lot because you don't have enough common sense to go there. Someone else will come get your order."" Another man was old and thought that women should only cook and bear children. He was always so nice to the men, but really rude to me. I would give everyone the same speech. ""Just leave your car in park and the keys in the ignition. Give this ticket to the cashier. Thank you, and have a nice day!"" He would respond by shaking his finger in my face and saying ""Don't you fucking tell me what to do!"" We would offer a free exterior rewash if you brought your receipt back within 2 days. This one woman that was the definition of a prude would always come in for her rewash. She would never have her receipt with her. She would always say ""They've never asked for my receipt before."" After about the 9th time I told her ""Ma'am, I am always the one that takes your order. I tell you every single time that you have to bring your receipt back. You have only paid for one wash out of the last 10. You can not have a wash today unless you pay for it."" She gets huffy and purses her lips and says ""Excuse me? Are you accusing me of lying? You know that I make more money than you, right?"" I say ""Oh, you do? Then you shouldn't have a problem buying a $5.00 wash."" When she goes into the wash her car started jumping over the rollers that push your car through. So now her car is stuck in the middle of the wash. We shut it off and she rolls down her window and starts yelling about how we're incompetent and our washing is messing her car up. We tell her to make sure she's in neutral and not touching the brakes or steering wheel. ""I'm not stupid. I know how to go through a car wash."" Her car jumps the rollers again, except this time we're watching and see her brake lights come on as soon as the rollers start moving her. She starts yelling that she wants her money back because we're going to mess up her car. ""Ma'am, we just watched you put your brakes on. If anything, you're going to mess up our wash. You will not be getting a refund."" AANNNDD the best. There was a really really old lady that would come in. She was one of those people that comes to a complete stop before turning her wheel to turn in somewhere. I always knew she was coming in because I could hear people on the street honking at her. I would always meet her car before she got to where she needed to be because I didn't want her to drive anymore. One time she refused to get out and wanted to drive her car through the wash herself. I was standing down the lot and directing her on where to go. She hits the gas, hits me, I flip over the top of her car, land on the concrete, watch her jump the curb(as she hits a shopping cart that flies so fast it sticks in a wooden fence), go into the lot next door and do a donut, and hop back over the curb and crash into the side of our building. We had to share an ambulance. She was 90 years old and her kids weren't keeping her from driving or watching over her. She was holding the gas in the whole time, thinking it was the brake. Out of all that time she didn't think that maybe she's not pressing the brake."

Second, thank you to the community who make this game what it is today, trolls, toxic ninja looters and nice guy's alike. What's a wow journey without some asshole stealing the trinket you wanted for ages then mass kicking everyone? I'll try not to waffle on too much but I've said it a few times in this subreddit before, my father and brother both played wow. We had a family account we loved to play, my father passed away in 2011 along with my mother later in the year. My brother got the account banned and I made my own in 2012 after months of what I'd like to call hell, my brother was a drug addict after our parents died, we were living in poverty and hounded by debt collectors. Later that year I pulled us over 1000km away from that and we started a life here, but I never got better, WoW was that one outlet for me that really helped me keep stable, helped me stay social even though I left the house less than once a month. Raiding was a huge passion of mine as I couldn't work anymore like I used to and felt I was fulfilling some purpose, after caring for my dying mother for 3 years, I lost the will to live for myself, and have now for the last 5 years, dedicated my life to my brother and getting him better which he slowly is and I feel safe enough now to let him live his life on his own. Thank you for the years of happiness, thank you for the years of keeping me afloat but unfortunately over the last 6 months however, I've been declining in mental and physical health quite rapidly, I was diagnosed with multiple permanent illnesses that have a good chance of getting much worse than they are and i'm showing the signs of others, and I do not want to continue on letting them worsen and I have stopped my medication, I am also at very high risk of what killed my mother (and her father, and my fathers mother, etc) and I do not want to go like they did. I loved this game, and I hope it continues to be made well after I am gone, although I will be spending the next few months setting up for my departure. I am going to log out in my favourite spot, The Secret Aerie pond, looking out into the mountains and the sky in Pandaria for one last time before giving my account to someone I love very dearly, who I have had to say goodbye to in order to save him from hurting. I don't know when the end will come, but its inevitable. Again, thank you for having me Azeroth, dioniss aca From, just your average Draenei Mage."

1,How about just reduce her base AD by 5.,leagueoflegends,212,24/12/2016 13:01,"Camille deserves nerfs - but lets do it right I've spammed the ever loving hell out of camille lately and have just recently hit mastery 7 on her, and I can confirm that she is busted. However I feel like what riot generally ends up doing is just nerfing the base stats or damage of a champ like her until she is effectively gutted. There are less drastic ways to nerf her that will still keep her as a viable pick, but not as oppressive. The main thing with her that makes her hilariously busted in my opinion is her ability to trade for free in lane with little to no counterplay for most opposing toplaners. Unless you are playing jax, poppy, or fiora, camille's lane is almost as abusive as renektons with her also scaling better into the game. The main issue is the q2 prep e-aa-q combo, which can deal an upwards of a third of someones health with absolutely no way to deal with it. So what are the best ways to nerf her? -Increased e cooldown in the early levels by a lot, I feel like a ~20 second cd will keep her ability to trade for free down -Remove attack speed buff on e, its a completely unnecessary stat boost and I'm not quite sure why its there -Make her shield health percentage scale by level, starting at 10% and increasing to 20% These nerfs will serve to bring her back in line without going too far, if she still needs nerfs after that she can get looked at again"

This was a while ago when I was 17 years old. I had just finished my shift at Waitrose (a UK supermarket), my mum picked me up from work and we stopped off at a petrol station on the way home. The petrol station was one of those that were part chain-supermarket - this one was part Marks &amp; Spencers. (For clarification, my uniform was white, with a green tie, and a grey apron with 'WAITROSE' emblazoned on it. The Marks &amp; Spencers uniform is all black. I was also wearing a coat and had my hair down.) I was just browsing waiting for my mum to pay, when a lady came up to me: Lady: ""Where are the nuts?"" Me: ""Oh, really sorry, I don't work here."" (I then pointed to the huge 'WAITROSE' on the front of my apron. ""I'm just still in my work uniform from Waitrose."" Lady: ""...So where are the nuts?"" Me: ""Like I said, don't work here, so I don't know. I'm sorry?"" Lady: ""Excuse me? Where's your supervisor, you're being rude."" Me: ""I wouldn't know, since I don't work here? There's an employee over there, I'm sure they'll know where the nuts are."" The lady then storms over the M&amp;S employee and starts loudly proclaiming that a ""member of their staff"" was being rude to her and refusing to serve her by pretending to not work in the shop. I made eye-contact with the employee and gesture to my 'WAITROSE' apron. The employee explains to the lady that I don't work here. Lady: ""Then why is she PRETENDING to work here?"" Employee: ""She's just doing her shopping, like you were."" Lady: ""That's ridiculous. She needs to leave, she's confusing people. You should ask her to leave."" Employee: ""I'm not going to do that, she has as much right to be here as you."" Lady: ""That's ridiculous, I want to speak to your manager."" At this point I was on my way out anyway, so I didn't hear how the lady was dealt with, but I've never experienced something like that again. tl;dr: told a lady I didn't work in the store, she accuses me of lying and says I shouldn't be allowed in the store because I don't work there."

She stopped what she was saying to mention that I looked really good in the tux. Also, at our opening night party, she asked me to sit with her and her parents.

Like twice a week we'd get lunch from there. (We were 21 and perpetually drunk/hungover) My buddy orders his Whopper with something minor, like no onions, add barbecue sauce. Gets it and its a Whopper Junior. Check receipt and he paid for a Whopper. Goes to get it fixed. They remake it, hand it to him and its just a regular Whopper. He goes back again, ""Hey, it's the right burger, but it's got onions and no BBQ sauce."" Gets it fixed again. Opens up the third one and its plain with nothing but lots of onions and BBQ sauce. Literally piled high with onions and drenched in BBQ sauce. He's getting frustrated, but trying not to take it out in the poor girl at the register. The burger guy now starts running his mouth from behind the hot lamps saying he's made it as asked every time, just being a rude cunt. Cue my buddy throwing his burger at the guy, drilling him in its over-saturated glory right in the guys face. Manager finally comes out of hiding and ends up banning my buddy and firing the burger cook. My buddy refuses to leave until he gets his money or correct order back. All the while me JD our other buddy are eating, and watching the best live theater during dinner we had seen in ages. In the end he got his money back, we left and took him to McDonald's. A week later that BK burnt down. Two months later it was rebuilt. A month after that, burnt down again."

People who are new to the idea of alignment always equate evil=psycho. An evil person is not always a sadistic lunatic. A lot of the time they don't see themselves as evil at all. They love their mothers and their dog, they make friends, and they do nice things for people. Just because they're willing to commit evil acts doesn't mean they don't follow their own sense of morality. Also, most evil people understand that acting outside of the norm will get them in trouble and they will avoid that attention. The edgy ""evil"" character who murders the helpless prisoner in front of the entire party and then acts ""baffled"" when everyone is offended will not and should not last long. The right kind of evil player would wait until the party is asleep, fake an injury before stabbing the prisoner in the chest, and then convince everyone that they were attacked and the prisoner was trying to escape. Or he would attempt to corrupt the party, convincing them with smooth words why killing the prisoner is the best course of action and offer to do it himself to spare everyone else the deed. So remember kids, evil does not always mean sociopath."

0,"The more fun the toy, the longer the cooldown.",wow,172,26/03/2016 17:47,"Why are the cooldowns on toys so sporadic and weird? Title. The cooldowns for Toys seem rather arbitrarily implemented, without any concern for what the toy actually does. Gamon's Braid has a 2-hour cooldown, Iron Boot Flask has a 1-hour cooldown. I looked back through previous posts but none of them really seem helpful. ""It ruins the flavor of WoW if you can just spam them constantly."" Makes little sense depending on how long you play. If a *majority* of people play for 5+ hours a day, then alright, I could see limiting the use of Toys. But some of them just have baffling CDs for no real reason. Hell, Moroes' Famous Polish is debatably more ""game-changing"" than either of the above because it shows your character as being as naked as possible, but it only has a 30 minute CD by comparison. Spirit of Bashiok summons the dancing tree that's on fire for like 3-5 minutes, but has an hour CD, whereas Archmage Vargoth's Spare Staff has a 2 minute cooldown and lasts around the same time as far as I'm aware. Even if the items all cause strain on the servers, which I'm sure they do when spammed (Like the Haunted Memento's ghost thing apparently), that doesn't change the inconsistency with regards to the cooldowns. How is the cooldown decided? Orb of Deception lets you change into a member of the Horde for 5 minutes with a 30-minute CD. Iron Boot Flask makes you an Iron Dwarf for 10 minutes with an hour CD. The Bloodmane Charm makes you into a Saberon, with a 30-minute CD too. It's not like all of them are abuseable in some way. Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I just can't wrap my head around it."

She's not a health nut. Neither am I, we're both obese (I'm trying!) with a rare disease that affects some of our weight issues, although hers are compounded with diabetes and numerous other problems. Nmom is an addict. She gets narcotics for her chronic pain and over does it (pain which I also have but fight through). This is not good for her kidney. She smokes (started again 10 years ago after stopping for 20 years)... and has had breast cancer. Anyway... she likes to grab my back and tell me she's owed one of my kidneys. Because she gave birth to me. So I owe her a spare. And she doesn't worry so much about her remaining kidney giving out. As I owe her mine and we're sure to be a match... (yep). Had a daughter.

So, I don't know how to post the story after I made the OP so I'll put it here for all to see and if someone lets me know the right way to do it, I'll move it. We rented a beach house with a path through the sand dunes to the beach. I was told on multiple occasions by the homeowner that the small space we planned to use was semi-private (private isolated area between two public beaches) and does not require a permit for weddings. There have been 13 other weddings at that location without issue. I also tried to research permit requirements on that beach to do my due diligence and found nothing that required it for that area. The ceremony was only 22 people (mainly family) so they all helped with set up. I was getting ready so was not part of the set up. My helpers informed me later that they saw the PO ride by on his ATV multiple times and he said nothing. It was clear that it was a wedding with white chairs lined up and an arch with white fabric wrapped around it. He also saw me walking the path to the ceremony, before the ceremony began, in my wedding dress. There were multiple occasions to ask about our permit. When he pulled up on his ATV it was loud and not discreet so I turned around to see what was happening and he then asked me if we had a permit (instead of discreetly asking a guest since there were no ushers/planners). I told him it was semi-private beach and that I was told I didn't need a permit. He kept repeating that I needed a permit. Family members started chiming in and being sassy and I asked them all to be quiet and asked him if he could please let us finish and it would only be 15 minutes. He hesitated and I told him I'd be happy to give him my information and pay whatever fine we needed to (assuming I got wrong information and we needed a permit). He hesitated again and I pleaded again for him to please let us finish. He finally relented and just left. Afterwards as we were taking pictures, another PO drove by and I asked 'are we okay to take pictures, the ceremony is over?' He said 'oh yeah no problem, take your time' and was not concerned about our lack of permit. I talked to the vacation home owner afterwards and he was shocked to find out this happened. He again assured me 13 weddings have taken place there without permit because it was semi-private beach and asked for the PO's info. I'm contacting the city to determine if indeed a permit was needed so I can inform the homeowner either way. If it wasn't needed, I'll report the PO so he is aware of the beach boundaries in the future. I was the least upset about the situation, family members were more angry than I was. I think it's a funny story to add flavor to our wedding. However, in retrospect, he could have found another opportunity to ask about the permit than after the ceremony began and could have handled it better in general. I don't mind that he asked, which is within his job duties, but he could have also been respectful about it. He also had a pretty shitty grin the during the encounter that made me feel like it was a power play. That could just be me though..."

MIL: Coming! MIL says she'll be right back. *Gets up and leaves* Maliwhat: *Smashes forehead into dinning room table* Thankfully she got side-tracked, and I went to bed early. &amp;nbsp; How has this woman gotten through life?

So, before my boyfriend and I started dating again, (we dated before, in 2013), he and one of his band mates had a threesome with this girl that my boyfriend had feelings for. This happened in the past, and it shouldn't bother me, but it does. It probably wouldn't bother me so much if she wasn't around alllll the time. She's now dating the other band mate so she goes to every show and she's constantly around. It makes me super insecure because I notice him staring at her. A lot. Especially during their shows. It upsets me and makes me angry. When I bring it up to him, he tells me that he loves only me and he doesn't like her and ""she's with (bandmate), so it doesn't matter"" but it does matter! His body language and eyes say a completely different story. It makes me so mad where I'll just shut down and try to shut him out. I've been cheated on by almost all the men I've been with so I already have trust issues issues and need more reassurance than ""normal"" people do. It's wearing me down having to be around her. She's a total flirt, too. She has trouble with boundaries and I'm really just tired of it. I've thought about ending my relationship (which sucks, because I'm definitely in love and he's awesome and we live together) over this because I can't keep feeling this insecure and anxious about it. I feel like maybe I'm not communicating it to him properly so he understands how I feel. But it's ruining our relationship and I hate it. Tldr; girl my boyfriend had a threesome with is constantly around and flirty and makes me want to throw myself into the sun."

He would have to find someone competent that would be able to run the team day-to-day for him, that also understands (or is a quick learner) on the intricacies of this space. Rick Fox is one of the few heavily involved team owner/investors - he's impressed me. This is not specific to Mark, it goes for any potential HNWI/Angel/VC money. Example: Sacramento Kings gets Gerard Kelly, Immortals gets Noah Whinston, etc. We all want him involved and we know he's actively watching the space. However he has the luxury that he can afford to be patient, when many others cannot."

And mousesports is starting to look a lot like Titan when they had kennyS and apEX. But here's an unpopular opinion: NiKo is the reason mousesports hasn't been that great. Remember when mousesports first upset the international scene? Back in May-August they had a steady run of solid upsets and top 4 finishes. This ended in Cologne 2015, where they bowed out of groups and they removed Spiidi for NiKo. And since then, nothing has gotten better. In fact I would argue their previous results with gob are more impressive than current ones, and more consistent. Gob used Spiidi, denis, and chrisJ better, and we can clearly see that. Just head over to their stats page and view the difference from 3 months and 2015.

I was the main guy tasked with the hard stuff (repairs, people). Lady walks in, eyes shrinkwrapped in tears, clinging to a huge ziplock freezer bag. Inside? Oh that's just some sort of reddish-orange liquid sloshing around a white macbook. So I look at the half-filled bag of soup and macbook then over to the lady. me: what happened? her: I turned my back during lunch, one of my 'delightful' students emptied my campbells cup o soup onto my laptop. for fun. me: yaaaaaay? her: sobbing something about saving and so much money down the drain. me (unspoken): got me in the feels lady Apparently she is just out of school, strapped with student debt, and this little mac is what she wanted and could afford. She saved for nearly 6 months and waited for the new ones to come out and jumped on the purchase. I'm really starting to feel for her here, I've got educators all in my family so I *KNOW* teachers get paid for shit. I should point out that policy at the time did not cover accidental damage. I struggled to find SOMETHING we could do for her. Me: I've got some time coming up for lunch, I want to try and recover data (also something we didn't do, but this was undiscovered country for me) her: OMG thank you my life is on that (it always is!!) Still not satisfied with the solution, I find our regional manager on the phone, get her to approve a SWAP out. I then proceed to pull the SATA drive from her campbells cup 'o' laptop and place it on a spare drive dock. Grab an ultimate white macbook, whatever that was at the time, and I proceed to flash her data via firewire transfer mode (target mode). Customer comes back, I start telling her that something went strange with the data transfer, I need her to look things over first. I bring out her new macbook but she doesn't know it is hers and likely figured it was one of ours for previewing data. She looks it over and, satisfied that her data is at least safe, says ""Great! I gotta run to best buy and get a hard drive to back this up to."" I recommended she go anywhere else to buy an external drive since my store was pricey for accessories. anyway... I close the lid, put everything back in the box and hand it to her. Me: here, now take your laptop and get out of here. Be sure to watch out for soup. Her: Stunned, crying again, very grateful. She came back a few times with baked goods, I LOVED that job. LATER Asked to come out from the back to handle a situation. A little kid wanders in, all of 10-11 years old. I ask what he needs help with, his Mom gestures with her hand. He gives me a crayola drawing of said fruit company logo, with stick figures that I assume are me and the lady. Below it said ""thanks for saving my teacher's apple, I'm sorry for dumping the soup"""

There's also the flash+Tibbers+Q+W+Q+Ignite to take anyone from 100-0 on Annie. So what are your favorites? IMO, nothing beats a QRQ combo on Lee Sin to execute someone. RQE is also pretty hilarious on AP Malphite. In addition, which combos do you find the most awkward? IMO it's got to be Viktor's. Three different types of abilities in his QER (in any order) with 3 unique looking particle effects (opposite to Xerath's boss looking ERQRR) makes him just an awkward champion to play."

0,I had a feud with my English HS teacher as well so it makes me happy to hear about your victory.,AskReddit,130,21/10/2014 04:03,"Not currently exploiting, but when I was in high school. Near the end of the year, we would get these little carbon-copy packets which had the list of classes we could take the next year. We would put a check mark next to the class we wanted to take, and then the teachers would either approve or override our choices. If they approved, they would sign their initials next to the box we checked off. We kept the first page, and the teacher got the next two carbon-copy pages. For some reason, I decided I wanted to be in AP English. My heart was set on this, but, alas, my English teacher was a bitch and wanted to crush my soul in every way she could. She didn't like me, and I had asked her about AP English before only to be shot down. AP was for her favorites, of which I was not. I knew if I brought my packet up to her with the 'AP English"" box checked, she wouldn't initial it and I would end up stuck in the general (CP) English class next year. Which would have been fine, but I had already decided this was a war she would not fucking win. So I hatched the perfect plan. I marked CP on the white page, brought it up to bitch teacher, and she initialed with no questions asked, although I'm sure she was so satisfied in that moment. God she was a bitch. She proceeded to separate the copies, smugly. I got my white copy, and the other two went in the box to be filed or whatever the fuck they do with them. Little did she know, it just so happened that on these packets, AP English was listed directly above CP English. All I had to do was simply fold the first white page at the top, accordion-style, so the CP column on the first page aligned with the AP columns on the pink and yellow pages. Checkmate, bitch."

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound... But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."

I've been extremely anxious lately, so a few days ago, like an idiot, I thought to myself ""hey, why not start smoking again?!"". I didn't let them know, mostly because I was ashamed but also because I didn't feel like getting bitched at. I'm staying with them tonight, so I'd yet to smoke a cigarette for hours. About an hour ago, they both went to bed and were seemingly fast asleep. I saw this as an opportunity to sneak out on the balcony and have a relaxing smoke in the dark. I began smoking and browsing Reddit, as one does, when I heard a weird clicking noise. Within what seemed like a millisecond, the outside lights were on, the sliding glass door was open, and my father was standing 4 feet away from me pointing a handgun at me. He screamed, I screamed, my mother ran up the stairs and saw what was happening. I tried explaining myself but my dad won't speak and my mom is crying. Now I'm alone in the guest bedroom, feeling sick to my stomach and shaking.

The fact that there was an explosion of ""tea party"" and ""patriot"" groups, clearly political, that were claiming non profit status, is absolutely a legitimate reason for flagging them. Another article posted on reddit showed a judge already ruled against some of these groups that they were in violation of their non profit status by trying to influence the election.

Long story short, my brother and I don't look alike at all. So much so that every now and then out in public people comment on how we are a cute couple. For me that is never an issue, it is not their fault that I look like mom and he looks like dad. However, it has morphed into meaning that he refuses to sit next to me ANYWHERE. While this may seem trivial, we eat out pretty much every night and this has meant huge scenes in restaurants and making other family members move so that he doesn't have to sit next to me because those comments bother him so much (for reasons I don't really understand. Yes, its a little weird maybe, but strangers don't know, and its not actually harmful to anyone). The the comments started. I am happily with my bf [23m] of over 4 years currently in a long distance relationship (we got into two different grad schools). My brother has started making comments about how he ""is not my boyfriend."" For example, I say 'I like your shirt,' he says 'I'm not your boyfriend.' And its all the time. No matter what I say its ""im not [my bfs name]"" or ""im not your bf!"" Next came the clothing issue. Headed to the dentist brother was driving me so I wouldnt have to drive afterwards. I am running late, he is already in the car, I run out and hop in. He looks at me, turns off the car, and goes back inside that house without a word. He comes back in a different shirt. I ask him surprised why he needed to change shirts. He says ""we were wearing the same color."" That was over a month ago, and since then he has changed clothes 6 times if we have had on the same color. I dont mean the same shirt, I mean like anywhere on the entirety of the blue spectrum. Anything that is similar. Then tonight for dinner, the reason for this post, is that my family was sitting down to eat -at home- and everyone was already seated. He comes around the corner, sees the only empty chair is next to me, and immediately turns around and walks to the other side of the table and stands behind my sister. TO EAT DINNER. Mom finally tells him to stop being dumb and sit down, but he makes a big production of moving the chair over as far as possible. I need some sort of advice. This is driving me crazy. I have never done anything to him, I'm not physically intimidating, and I'm not gross. This only started because a handful of people said yall area cute couple. I dont know why this bothers him so much, but its getting difficult to do things with my family when dinner and movies are a hassle over seating. In public was one thing, and maybe its just weird to him as a younger brother for people to think that your sister is your gf. But who cares?? its not hurtful or damaging. And he makes SUCH a big deal about it in public its so embarrassing. I *almost* understand public, but then it happened at home tonight and this is just insane. I have expressed to him that his behavior is hurtful, but that doesn't seem to matter. Why does this bother him so much?? What can I do??"

This scene has been hyped for so long, it was bound to let some people down. Personally I had no problems with the TOJ scenes, I think Lyanna's actor nailed the character and she did a terrific job. I don't mind if she wasn't a fan of the series at all and in my opinion this has nothing to do with someone's performance as an actor. Lena Headey hasn't read the books as far as I know and she does an incredible job. She's also my favorite casting choice, albeit one of the most disputed. I thoroughly enjoyed the TOJ scenes even though something about Young Ned's actor seemed off."

I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Tom Brady, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity, something illusory.

I said that expecting a few more joke candidates to come out like Neil deGrasse Tyson for the Dems, or Dr. Phil running as an independent sponsored by Pfizer, or even Jon Stewart (although i know he respects politics to much to do that). But he remained the sole ""joke"" candidate. (He's a joke because he's been saying ridiculous and very unpolitical things since day 1). Then one day a couple weeks back he said he wanted to build a full scale wall across the Mexican/US border and deport all immigrants. His numbers went up. Now I was watching the news earlier today. He was seen kicking some Hispanic reporter out of his news conference for trying to question him about the giant wall. The way he called over his security it looked like a god damn supervillain movie scene. The classic two fingers ""get over here"". Then they said Trump is still steadily rising in the polls. ""Voters say they are impressed by his brash views."" How is this man even a possible candidate? If he is voted in, America is officially over. That man will go bonkers with power. I don't think Americans understand who they are voting for. Not because of the man they saw on tv, but because of the man they did not see on tv. Donald Trump is a ruthless businessman who will kill anyone who stands in his way. Please don't give him more power, America."

One day while I was doing dishes, the 2 youngest kids took him outside and tried to drown him in the above ground pool. Twice. He survived. * My in-laws house was filthy and roach infested. While one of the kids was eating dinner, a roach apparently crawled across his plate, he started hysterically crying. I go to calm him down and one of the others runs into the kitchen, opens every spice she can get get hand on and dumps them all over the kitchen. * I decide I have to keep the two smaller ones with me at all times due to their antics. I put them on the kitchen counter to 'help' me cook. They actually start behaving and I thought I had found a successful method in handling them. I was wrong. One asks me a question while the other takes out glasses from the cupboard and starts smashing them on the ground. I go to stop her when the other little one starts smashing plates. * The two oldest were sisters and they *hated* each other. They get into a fight over the TV (could have been over the xbox, I can't quite remember) the older sister starts chasing after the younger sister, she eventually smashes the younger sister's fingers in the bathroom door.

CLG is being bashed by the same people for 2 years, all new posts involving Elements involve ton of shitposts since the forming of the team (ALL), SK got bashed pretty hard for not shoving in playoffs, Coast was just meme whole season, just like Liquid was until playoffs. And now everyone is so disgusted by all the hate TSM got. If you play bad you get flamed bad, just deal with it. Other teams at least didn't pretend to be hot sh1t. All was hyped by fans, nor Froggen nor any other ALL player said that they will crush everyone (reddit created hype themselves and when it didn't happen - blame others), but what they got was even worse than what TSM is getting. And no, no one who have at least some knowledge of the scene predicted TSM to go top 2. They said they can do it, but honestly, I haven't seen anyone to prefer TSM over SKT or EDG, just wishful and pitiful NA personas (hoping that trashing NA means something in context of international strenght). TSM had best chance ever to finish top 2, but it still was far-fetched. And at last. I wish for trashtalking segments. Good trashtalking, not TSM-like. In LCK everything is prepared for the hype and text is witty, funny. TSM just bash. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY if you trashtalk, be ready for consequences. Just like Godgiven trashtalked and then he gets what he deserves like a man, not some pussy. Dear TSM, crash and burn. Ty."

0,"To be fair though, pulling out a guy's heart and showing it to him while it's still beating is pretty fucking intense for a PG rating.",movies,118,09/08/2016 03:14,"You have to understand the history of our ratings. Initially there was G, PG, and R. Movies could be rated X, but that just meant that the MPAA refused to rate the movie, or that the filmmakers declined to have it rated by the MPAA. Because of that, anyone could use the X rating, which is why X-rated movies became associated with porn. G used to actually mean movies that didn't have any objectionable material. Star Trek: The Motion Picture, for example, was rated G, even though it had some scary moments like the transporter accident. R was reserved for movies that actually were for adults. Movies with sex (although not explicit), or language, or excessive gore. And PG was supposed to be somewhat in between. You could get away with a little nudity, violence, and a bad word here or there, and parents were supposed to take this into account when deciding whether or not their children should see the movie. But of course, people being what they are, somehow thought ""Parental Guidance"" meant ""Do my parenting for me"" and when movies like Temple of Doom pushed the envelope of what a PG movie could be, they insisted that a new rating be made. And that called that PGWRMITTNSYSLYT (Parental Guidance We Really Mean It This Time No Seriously Don't Let Your Kid Watch), which was really hard to remember so they shortened it to PG-13 because the second part had 13 words in it. And a few years later they did the same for R, and they created NCYCRSATFSTMJLHIHRA (No Chance You Can Really Stop A Teenager from Seeing This Movie Just Lock Him in His Room Already) which became NC-17."

He decided to go home, one of my friends went out with him, told the taxi driver where he lived and to bring him there. Well, he told the driver to go to my place. I should note, I lived abroad and my accommodation was provided by the company I worked for and had strict rules for visitors. No guests past midnight being the main one. My then-bf climbed the ~15ft wall, *which had barbed wire on it*, and came into my room. I initially thought I was hallucinating from my medicine when I saw him. He climbed into my bed, stole the blankets, took over most of the bed and passed out. I went out to sleep on the couch 'cause we have a blanket there. My housemate came in around 7 and asked why I was sleeping on the couch, I told her about bf, and she was furious since she and my friends had basically told him to leave me the F alone.

Maybe I'm alone in this echo chamber here, but I have been seeing a lot of posts recently claiming that Trump is the next libertarian candidate, and I've got to say, its crazy how many people believe this joke. The guy is a total authoritarian who will pander to literally every crowd to try to get votes. Not one word he says is believable. He's pro patriot act, pro NSA, pro overzealous military spending, interventionism, and anti-individual rights, wanting to block specific groups of people based solely on race and religion. I understand a lot of people in this sub probably feel the pull to find a candidate to support in the general election. They want someone that won't fuck them over fiscally. Well, I've got news for you, and you're not gonna want to hear it, but here it is; **You're fucked regardless of which party gets elected.** Whether it be Bernie, Hillary, Trump, Cruz, or Rubio, every single one is going to expand the budget, take away your 4th amendment rights, attack internet freedoms, expand the role of the executive branch, and all around be a pain in your ass. Me, I'm done with their bullshit. I have been for a long time. I'll do what I did in '08 and in '12 after Paul dropped out, and I will protest vote the presidential election for the Libertarian party in all likelihood. What is probably more important at this point is for us to start identifying our most promising State legislators who will fight Washington tooth and nail, and be sure to get them elected. The fight for presidency is just a fight to be head puppeteer. For the time being, they still need congress and the house to get things done, and if we can organize enough support in those two places, maybe we can finally fight back against executive branch encroachment. Thomas Massie, Justin Amash, Rand Paul, they all need more help! They need more people backing them, more congress(wo)men, more senators to help push back against overbearing federal legislation. We have become too shortsighted, as we always do come presidential election season. Lets keep our eyes on the prize, and continue pushing forth candidates that are honest and consistent, and who are true role models for liberty. We need them now more than ever."

I sat in a classroom, waited to be called for my interview, and walked into a room full of cameramen, producers, sound people, light people, etc. I was already nervous and he came at me with sick questions that made me uncomfortable to the point I started crying for my mom.

A lot of the time long-term coaching skill is a complete roll of the dice, but I'm curious who's on peoples' radars right now. Personally, I could see Harbaugh being part of a stat like this in a few years. There also seemed to have been a consensus before the season that Herman was gonna be the next big coach, but I feel like that's cooled off a bit after Houston's current struggles (though Herman is undoubtedly a very good coach).

I have never been in a relationship, much less had sex (lesbian and just now leaving TSCC, I've never had the opportunity). A couple years ago, I got curious and started reading articles/blogs about healthy relationships, including sex and how it fits in a healthy relationship. I even looked at a smidge of porn simply because I couldn't imagine how sex could work. Sex ed failed me, so I turned to the internet. I started to feel guilty about doing all this, and decided to find out if mormon sex was different. I found a couple blogs about sex/relationships run by mormons, and promptly discovered that mormon sex tended to involve praying before, crying after, feeling guilty af, and no oral. Comparing the two, there was a clear winner- nevermo sex was obviously far more healthy and fun. This actually put a big crack in my shelf; after all, why would god create something as awesome as sex and then attach so much shame and guilt? I feel like I might be the only one here who could be categorized as partly ""leaving to sin"", although it's more complex than that. Did any of you guys experience something similar?"

Before he had teenage sons) and has gained a lot of weight and with it came diabetes. After being in denial for a year, he came to terms with it and started eating right again and bringing his lunch to work instead of hitting the grill for a quick burger and fries to and started exercising again to help lose weight. After a while, he noticed his meals going missing out of the fridge at work and he started asking around to his co-workers and most of then pointed out ""Ralph"" was eating whatever container my dad described his food being in. He approached ""Ralph"" about it and Ralph quickly fessed up and said it wouldn't happen again, but he continued anyway. After a while, my dad got aggravated not because he would have to find a replacement for his meal, but because this guy would blatantly eat the food in front of people not giving two cares who saw. So my dad hatched a plan. He decided to make Ex-Lax brownies and bring a plate to work with him. Now most of his co-workers hated ""Ralph"" because he's already eaten their food already and ended up in on the joke. So they knew to steer clear. My dad walks in with his ""lunch"" and sees Ralph chilling out. He tells Ralph to stay away from his lunch and not to eat it and Ralph agrees to do it. Needless to say, food went missing and Ralph ran between his office and the bathroom so many times, he ended up shitting himself. After cleaning up as much as he could, Ralph went to the boss and ratted my dad out saying he was poisoned by him. My dad gets called in, is asked about his ""food"" and told the boss that he told Ralph to stay away from the food. Boss looks at Ralph and asks if this is true, Ralph says ""that's not the point."" Boss responds with sending him home because he smelled like shit and ended up transferring him to another branch a week later. Tl;dr my dad got tired of his asshole coworker eating his lunch that he slipped ex lax brownies as revenge"

One day at work after school I found a shared network drive with a program called RCON on it and was curious what it was. So I opened it, and it asked me for a username and password. So I tried every set of credentials I had been issued. Non Worked so I closed it and went about my tasks... The next day I get pulled into a room with lots of big wigs in it, principal, my step father, super intendant, etc. They then proceed to tell me they know I tried to hack the school board server to change my grades. I was speechless... Turns out RCON.exe is the remote control console for the AS/400 that grades/report cards etc are stored on.... I had no clue, was just curious. But I was supposedly bullshitting them and they knew I was an ELITE hacker..... I had to write a 10 page report on computer ethics... Then I was on such a close watch that if I so much as hit a forbidden link I was going to be fired and suspended from school. Well... I go to the bathroom in networking class and forget to lock my screen on my lab computer... One of the kids (thinking it would be funny) hits a bunch of blocked sites on the computer and closes them. The next day I'm pulled into the office, so now not only am I a hacker, but I'm a rebel, and disobeying authority, no regard for the rules, etc etc etc They fire me from my Tech Job and Suspend me from School.

She just moved to a different country for his career, and OP is sad he doesn't have any friends, well congrats OP, your wife probably doesn't have any friends either, and the ONE thing she has been able to count on for consistency's sake was the dinner night, which you cancelled without even talking to her about it first, instead of trying to reach a solution that worked for both of you first. And then, when she got (understandably) upset, instead of staying and working it out, you went and left for the night, leaving her home with the kids by herself while you pay for a hotel room. Does the hotel room cost more money than the pizza night would have? Probably. How much money are you spending now on cigarettes? Look, as someone who has moved to a different country, I get it. It is incredibly stressful to uproot your life and move somewhere where you don't know anyone. But you've only been there for a couple weeks, so you are both likely still going through culture shock. There are always tons of hidden expenses in moving, and I am sure this is stressing you out. But you and your wife need to be a team, and you need to sit down together and budget, and make it through this together. You can't just run away every time there is an issue. If she has to stay home watching the children while you go to work each way, I guarantee you she feels even MORE isolated than you do. At least you have work to go to, with built in interaction with others, and a support network. Unless she can reach out and find other ex-pats and other mom groups or something, the only person she has is you, so of course she reacted badly when you wanted to cancel the dinner plans that she was probably looking forward to all week. You need to go back home and apologize, and then the two of you need to find ways to support each other emotionally through this, and go over finances, and make sure you're on the same page."

1,"Remember, vacations don't count without pictures posted on social media every step of the way.",relationships,105,22/06/2016 17:01,"My girlfiend has been depressed and sad because I don't want to take my expensive DSLR camera on vacation. There are a lot of elements to this situation, and I don't write very clearly, so please if anything is written incorrectly or needs clarification just post a comment and I'll get to it. My girlfriend and I have been together for one year now. For me, I enjoy a little bit of photography, I am generally into art and this is just one of the facets. Now, it seems that every girl that I have dated has also found the photography to be really cool, I think a lot of this has to do with social media which I don't blame them. Personally I too enjoy posting cool pictures up on my Instagram. This summer we have a trip planned in Euroupe and I decided that I don't want to bring my camera along. The reasons for this are that it is bulky, expensive, and I never get any pictures of myself. It ends up just ends up me taking photos of other people and its just not that fun for me. My last vacation with my ex-girlfriend, all I had for it was selfies that I took with my own phone. I told my girlfriend this that I don't want to take my camera and explained to her all the reasons. She says that she gets it but that if I loved her that I would bring the camera and we wouldn't have to use it all the time. I told her that I just rather not. She has been really upset about this, and said that I did it for my ex-girlfriend why can't I do the same for her. I told her that I learned my lesson from my ex-girlfriend and I don't want to bring it. She then comes up with that because my ex-girlfriend was prettier than her and blonde etc. thats why I did it for her, but not for her(my current girlfriend). I told her none of that is true, but she doesn't believe me. This has basically soured our relationship, the trip she was really excited about now she is upset about it. I don't know what to do about this. I don't want to be a camera man for my own vaction, and I would much rather just both of us take our phones but it doesn't look like its going to happen. What should I do? **Tl;Dr- I don't want to bring my DSLR camera on vacation, my girlfriend is really upset.**"

So like all tifus this didn't happen today but in June when one of my best friends got married. He tasked me with the job of music at the reception, just computer to speaker stuff, this was a simple affair, no DJ or band. Both me and the groom are huge ASOIAF/ GoT nerds. For some lulz I decide to prank the best man, a mutual friend, by interrupting his toast with the song ""The Rains of Castamere"", which is a song from the show. Spoilers ahead, ye be warned. This song is a dirge commemorating a character's ruthless extermination of his enemies. During a wedding in season 3 there is a massacre of the guests orchestrated by this character, and the song is used as the cue to start the bloodshed. In this scene several important characters die in a shocking and gruesome hail of crossbows at the wedding feast. So I decided to play this song at my friends wedding reception. The groom thought it was hilarious, he turned red laughing, and the best man proceeded to go his best Walder Frey impersonation. Most of the guests were just confused. The bride on the other hand became inconsolably distraught and angry. She, in between sobs, demanded I leave, while trying to explain to her dumbstruck parents why she was so upset and why the song was so awful. I later learned that red wedding scene caused her to pass out a few years ago when it first aired. The groom does his best to console her while failing to hold back fits of laughter. I was asked to leave by the in laws. Now, months later, the bride won't speak to me and has done her level best to end me and the groom's friendship. TL;DR: played a wedding massacre sing from GoT at a wedding, triggered the bride."

Worst part was that I also said ""happy birthday ;)"" -mom asked to borrow some paper, grabbed a bunch out of an old binder for her, few hours later she silently handed me a list of blowjob tips I'd written down a few years ago and had thrown back in the binder -had a text conversation in 8th grade with my friend's girlfriend about how much I liked my friend and that it wasn't fair that he didn't like me back. I can't believe she was so nice about it -at a middle school dance I was grinding on some kid then I looked back and when he saw my face he immediately stopped and walked away God, I could go on forever. Whenever I think of something cringy I've done (and those moments probably make up about 60% of my time on earth), I audibly yelp or shiver because I'm so embarrassed."

A t-shirt dress from off the rack is more than fine. A custom designer dress including mock ups is fancier than my wedding dress. My mom bought her dress last weekend off the rack. I certainly wouldn't waste money on a dress if you might not even come."" Ok so it was a little bitchy but I mostly controlled myself ;) Then came this! ""You might have been empathic enough to realize that a person in a wheelchair has special requirements that must be taken into consideration. Sitting all the time requires something cool. The length of a dress has to cover most of the legs so that the fabric doesn't ride up and expose things other people should not see. Pantsuits are not something I ever see anymore. T-shirt dresses are way too casual. I'm not going to be humiliated by other people talking about how poor we must be if I couldn't afford a decent outfit (and believe me, the **her husband's side of the family** will tell me to my face and talk about it behind my back). Then I would be faced with comparisons to your family's attire. I haven't bought a new dress in four years because they always need alterations and Canadian stores have limited options. I usually end up buying online from the U.S. Then I end up giving them to charity because they're way too big, too long, shoulders hang, and many other things. I need something for a petite size that also is lovely and can be altered a few times. That way I can feel confident and maybe even believe that I look almost pretty, something that cruel remarks or side whispers and looks always ruin. I had wanted this to be special, the only wedding of a child of mine. But it seems I don't fit in anymore. BTW, (her husband) has suggested to me that (my FH) should eventually take what used to be called an Asperger's assessment.

Well, one morning I was playing it before he woke up and saved over his game. He had 54 hours of play time and I had just gotten to the Shinra building. Needless to say, he was pissed. His standard punishment at the time was to make us kneel in a corner, facing a wall, with our hands on our heads. He couldn't actually see the corner he chose because the couch was in the way, but he was sitting in the room watching TV, so I couldn't leave. I was only supposed to be there for a half hour or so, but, unfortunately for me, he fell asleep while watching TV. After kneeling there for awhile, I also fell asleep leaning against the wall. When my dad woke up, he completely forgot that he never let me out of the corner. About 6 or so hours later, I woke up and my legs hurt really bad from kneeling on the cold floor for so long. So, I'm crying and asking my dad if I could get up yet. Well, my parents start freaking out because they didn't even know I was there. I had no feeling in my legs, so I had trouble walking for a bit. Good times."

I'm on my mobile I work at a fast food place as a shift supervisor. We sell chicken buckets. And some of these buckets are heavy. You can tell they are when you pick them up. Most people are sensible about carrying them but not this family. So they came in with a torn bag and a bucket and place it on the counter. One of my cashiers calls me over to help them as obviously this was a issue and that's usually best for a manager to deal with. I walk up, smiling because though busy it had been an alright day. I will be M, the wife will be W and the husband will be H. M: Hi there, how can I help you? H: We were on our way to the beach and the bag tore, the chicken fell out. (Note this is a paper bag with no handles. The kind you're supposed to hold from the bottom, but they had it bunched at the top proving they held it there. So this was all on them.) M: Oh! What was inside? H: 8 piece special bucket we have M: Alright let me just get it replaced for you! (Even though it was their fault as a manager we're told to just replace it for things like that. It creates customer loyalty or something.) W: We would also like a refund. M: *blinks* I'm sorry I can't refund you. W: But it was your bag that broke! And if it was the proper lid the chicken wouldn't have fallen out! Give us a refund. M: We don't make the bags or the lids. They're corporate. W: Yeah but you still need to give us a refund! This is unacceptable these bags are horrible! At this point she was yelling rather unfairly so I stopped holding my tongue. M: We use these bags for all our buckets and most people don't seem to have an issue if they hold them properly from the bottom as the buckets are heavy and the bags aren't meant to be held by the top. I can't refund and replace it. H: This is horrible customer service! Give us just a refund then! And what's your last name! M: Okay I can give you a refund. And you don't need my last name if you're going to report this. (not that I was scared my GM would 1000000% back me up) I don't feel comfortable giving it to you. H: I will be reporting you! Don't you doubt it! This is horrible customer service! Wait till your boss hears! M: My general manager would actually agree with me in this situation. These are the general guidelines we follow. I gave them their money and they stormed out. Like I'm sorry you dropped your food but bare in mind I was not required to give you any sort of replacement. And even if it had been my fault I probably still wouldn't have given you both. Then I would've given you $60 in chicken and another $30 from the refund. You'd have cost us way more than your loyalty (customers I've never seen before!) would've been worth. Also you were rude. Bare minimum for you."

He is very annoying as you can see,"" the man said as I squirmed in the chair. The scent of blood was trapped in my throat by the thick band of tape wrapped around my face. An opening scarcely more than a slit by my nose caused my breath to come in thin wheezes, further inhibited by the liquid caking the inside of my broken nose. Letting out a brief whimper, I heard him sigh again at the noise. ""You see chat I mean?"" he addressed the invisible audience, ""I think ve should get on and crush it."" *He couldn't be serious.* From somewhere above me, the machinery rose in pitch, a high whine cutting across the rumble of the motors, and I knew what was descending upon me. At first first contact my hair was flattened against my head, the pressure then increasing on my scalp as my head was pushed downwards. The force increased and my chin collided my my chest, straining the muscles in my spine. I was hunched over further and the press continued downwards, forcing my chest into my knees and stretching my shoulders away from my hands which had been tied behind the chair. And still the push became stronger. I felt the first vertebrae pop somewhere in my lower back, directly below the column. Crying out in muffled agony, a ripple of cracks arched up my spine and my legs went numb as I felt my abdomen turn warm, a wet rush inside me as my pelvis compressed. My legs splayed out to one side as I continued to scream, my entire body now on fire as my brain struggled to interpret the signals it was receiving. I tugged at myself and something slopped onto the floor below. Through the clouds I saw a pile of string sausages linked together. How odd for him to put something like that down there. *Why hadn't I noticed before?* Huh. Odd how I feel hot and cold at the same time. As the darkness gripped at me with fingers of ice, I heard him laughing along with the woman beside him."

If you did a shitty job of taping up your box, and it fell apart on the line, then I hope you weren't shipping anything we might want. That said, this was when minimum wage was under $6 (hell, may have still been under $5.50), and UPS paid $9.25 (without drug testing), and you worked a ""shift"", meaning time-and-a-half if you worked over 4 hours in a night.

1,"Honestly who cares, they'll always buy a fucking shotgun on T-side anyway...",GlobalOffensive,96,03/03/2016 23:40,"Why BOTs will NEVER be able to drop weapons. Many people are requesting for a system to get the BOT to drop their weapon, much similar to how interacting with them causes them to drop the bomb. The flaw with a system like this would be that when a player leaves, the BOT gets their own pool of money, separate from the player who disconnected, starting from $800 and building up. The BOT uses this money to buy utility and weapons for itself. Now here is the problem; currently, when the player who disconnected re-joins, he ""destroys"" the BOT's money pool and its items, and the reconnected player starts with basic pistol, and the money he would have received in the rounds that he missed. This means that with the requested system you could make the BOT drop his weapon, and if the player re-joins within a certain time you would effectively have a free weapon from the BOT's cash pile, plus the reconnected player will be able to buy one of their own. This has potential to be exploited for extra weapons, since you will have 6 players worth of economy indirectly. The only way I can see round this is only letting BOTs drop weapons they have picked up, but this still allows an effective extra weapon to be carried when the player re-joins. If anyone has another solution to this problem, please comment, as it would be nice to see some other opinions on this problem! It would otherwise be a great feature to the game, since you may control a BOT and want to save a weapon, which you cannot access currently unless you die yourself. TL;DR - BOT's buy weapon, BOT's drop weapon, player re-joins with lots of extra money and a free weapon from the BOT's money."

I know, it seems crazy, but when you're the artist in a family of physicians, and when everyone is looking at you to follow in their medical footsteps, the pressure builds. So I went to therapy and explained how I'm the black, artist sheep of the family, how I'm pretty good at a lot of things but an expert of none, and how I envy those who have an obvious direction in life: a clear, birth-given talent. And you know what she told me? That those people are fucked. That someday, when for whatever reason they can no longer do/be/cultivate that one talent, they're completely lost. But that for people like us, who are somewhat good at a lot of things, we can simply move to the next without skipping a beat. And you know what? She was right. I made it my goal to learn as many trades as possible, so that should anything ever happen I could always fall back on something I knew how to do with my own two hands. I also started investing. Small amounts build up. I got a bank account outside of my regular bank account and didn't order a debit card; once the money was in it couldn't come back out, and I transferred money to my ""hands off"" account with every paycheck, even if it was just a couple bucks. I invested in real estate and found properties that make me 5.5% a year. No, it doesn't buy me flashy cars, but I'm getting rich slowly. I bought my first house. I bought a second house and turned the first one into a rental. I bought a third house and turned the second into a rental. I took all proceeds and put them into my investments. I started my own consulting and design company to foster what I found to be two things I'm really good at: negotiating and making shit pretty. I buy my fourth house in six months and my fifth and final house six months after that. I cook at home, I rarely buy clothes, and I get called names by my friends for being ""such a Jew"". (Their words, not mine). I'm a 37 year old woman. I've never been married. And I'll be retired by 39. You don't need passion. You need drive. Find what drives you - it can be a medley of shit. Stop worrying about what others think - those fuckers will be working until they're seventy while you sip champagne in Monte Carlo. Oh, and workout and eat well; it makes a world of difference. Plus looking good feels fucking great and gets you laid. Bonus."

I worked largely front end (cashier assisting, carts, etc). It just wasn't a good fit. I worked HARD for them (I had to regularly ice down my ankles at the end of the day), but for whatever reason the position didn't click with me. I was constantly on edge, with desperation looking for things to do (and I'm sure that desperation to be there showed, and not in a good way). I must have been horribly inefficient as they told me at 30 days I needed to improve my speed. After that, I knew I was going to get shitcanned. I wasn't physically capable of moving any faster, and asking others for help on improving my efficiency yielded no useful results. When I got fired, it was actually kinda funny. They booted a guy who was in the same orientation course with me, so I knew it was coming. After lunch, I got brought in for my ""60 Day review"" (something I had heard through the grapevine that they only give to people who are getting canned. Otherwise it's just a 30 and 90 day). Knowing this, I totally took control of the meeting. It basically went like this: Manager guy: Ok, so we are going to do your 60 day review. Here's how you did. Me: Going to go ahead and stop ya there - do we really need to do this? Manager guy (totally caught off guard): Uhh... ummm.. don't... you wanna know how you did? Me: Not really. You're firing me, right? Manager guy: .....uhh.... yeah... Me: Well then let's not bother to waste each other's time. The decision's already been made, so toss me the paperwork, I'll sign it and get outta here. Manager guy:.... umm.. ok. So he handed me the termination paperwork, and I decided I'd REALLY send the guy for a loop. In the employee comments section, I wrote down: ""I'm a chunky monkey from Funky Town!"" -Abraham Lincoln Then I signed it, turned in my badge, and that was the end of my Costco employment. Bummer, as I really wanted to work for them, but it just didn't work out. I don't hold any grudges against them. I've got Costco gas in my car right now, I use a SHITLOAD of Kirkland products. I'm a huge fan of the company, just a shame I couldn't be a part of it."

I didn't find it funny at all and on the grey borders of offensive but it was the reaction that made it cringy. Its just an offensive open-mic level thing. Its a little cringy because its not very good and its clearly not working on the audience but the mic cutting out and a bit of an awkward kicking-off made it a million times worse than it could have been. The last note (or two) and the solitary clap made it pretty bad. The actual song was only 20% of the situation there. If you can't handle offensive material then i'm not sure you're really well cut out for managing open-mic stuff. Kicking them out is one thing but bursting into tears over a subject not directed at you whatsoever is a bit much. tl;dr - Theres hundreds of more offensive but successful comedians out there. The cringe was mostly with the crying interruption and kicking out.

In theory, I am a lawyer. I say ""in theory"" because the best job I can do for now is to be a part-time contractor for a solo practitioner who just fired two of his clients for not paying their bills. He has no work for me this week, so I don't get paid. I used to have a full-time job with a firm, but made the mistake of being the youngest lawyer there when layoffs rolled around. I'm not broke *yet*, but give me a couple months and I'll be there. Clearly, I am not a good catch. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is a former public defender who is doing non-profit work *for fun*. She could walk into any criminal defense firm and practically write her own ticket, or sign up with another public defender's outfit any time she wants. She doesn't need the money, either; she's fucking rich. She is slumming it with me, and it's only a matter of time before she realizes that and cuts me loose. I've talked to her about this, and she tells me I'm full of shit, but I know she's biased. She'll realize I'm a failure and a loser soon enough and dump me like a sack of potatoes. So with that out of the way, my questions are: 1. Does anyone else ever feel like this, or have you in the past? What did you do about it? 2. Assuming a breakup is inevitable, should I head her off at the pass to lessen the blow to me? I'll grant that it's a dick-move, but having been dumped before I know how much it stings, and I do *not* want to be stung like that again, selfishness or no. I'll take my answer off the air."

Which you are not. You are using human terms to describe animals, whom I believe view life differently to humans. A bull doesnt take a cow out on dates then marry her then have kids. The bull 'rapes' the cow when she is on heat. In my opinion as a cow expert, the cow is unaffected by the process in which she gets pregnant. Separating the calf from the mother is sometimes tricky. As humans, we put human feelings onto animals. So we think the cow is feeling how a human would feel if the same happened to them. This is not true IMO. The cow realises she has no longer got the calf with her. Some cows immediately carry on with their life and forget instantly. Others have the natural maternal instinct to look for their calf or call for it for a short while. Then they too forget and concentrate on other things like looking for food. So to answer your question, I feel perfectly fine about the processes I use to produce milk."

Ectodermal Dysplasia is a genetic condition and there can be many symptoms, but one of my biggest is that I don't really sweat. Like I sweat probably about 1/5 of a normal person, which causes me to overheat very easily and I have to be careful when I'm in hot places. I put ALL of this information on my mission papers, told them that I definitely could not go anywhere hot UNLESS I had a car with A/C. Otherwise I can guarantee you I would have passed out, gotten physically sick, had massive headaches, etc. from exerting myself in the heat on a bike. Even just walking continually in heat would cause massive problems for me. So I get my mission call and guess where they called me to - Phoenix, AZ! I was so confused, how could they be inspired to call me somewhere I CLEARLY could not serve (because my SP called the MP over there and there were no missionary cars at the time). I thought it was a test of my faith on whether I'd obey priesthood leaders and go even though it didn't make sense. I told my SP, after much agonizing, that I just couldn't do it, I physically wouldn't be able to do the work I needed to. They assigned me to a new place and I went where they called me the second time. I used to think all of that was inspired, that the First Presidency was supposed to call me AZ first, that it taught me some great lesson I needed to know about following my own feelings/revelation and not just going along with my priesthood leaders. I guess it did teach me that though, and eventually lead to me going home halfway through my mission so I should be grateful for that :) Can you imagine if I'd tried to serve there though? That could have been extremely dangerous for my health! Stupid church."

Anyone who is uncomfortable with that can go fuck themselves."

It blows my mind but at the same time I am happy for her because she feels it has been great for her family and what they really needed (they moved away from family for the first time and have been struggling with some anxiety/mental health issues). She asked me why I left and I told her a little. She challenged me to reread the BOM blah blah blah. The biggest thing I took away from that conversation was this. I'm happy when families are happy and content, whether that be as atheist, mormons, baptists, catholics, etc. People who are Mormons (or any religion for that matter) feel sad that I'm not in their church even though i've expressed how happy and peaceful I am with my decision to leave. Isn't my mental health just as important? I didn't take leaving the church lightly. Anyways i just thought it was interesting. Can't we all just be happy for each other and not feel sad when someone is in a good place, even if it's not the same place you are? Also when she told me to read the BOM and linked to some LDS . org articles, I linked the CES letter to her just to explain my reasoning for leaving (since she kept asking)and told her it wasn't my intention to try and get her to leave the church again."

He's divorced with a 3 year old. We are both in law enforcement so we work 12 hour shifts but luckily we're on the same schedule. Because of his kid, I pretty much only see him if I go over to his house after he puts his kid to sleep or if we meet up for breakfast after working midnights, and sometimes if he is at my work for something he will come to see me. I've met his son a few times but even then it was just a quick meeting in public and I've met his parents once and his friends a few times. We get together most days but it seems like it's more of a hook up than anything, I don't even spend the night because he doesn't want his son to come into his bedroom and find me sleeping there. So anyways last week I found out that I'm pregnant. I'm not even sure how it happened, obviously the condom failed or he didn't pull out in time or something, but I told him and he barely reacted. He was just like ""oh shit, really?"" but quickly moved on. He hasn't brought it up since and I tried to ask him how he's feeling and he just said he doesn't know, he thinks he's excited and he thinks I'll look really sexy when I'm pregnant. He still wants to see me plenty it seems. I don't want to push him but obviously our arrangement is going to need to change and I just wish I could get some sort of reaction out of him. What should I do? I'm really scared and I wish I could talk about it with him but he has nothing to say. **tl;dr**: I'm pregnant with my boyfriend/guy I hook up with regularly's kid and he has barely acknowledged it but I wish we could talk about it."

An old work friend moved to a new house with his girlfriend, had a nice summer barbecue. So I went along. And it was great - got to catch up with my friend and two other good mates (we all used to play Battlefield together, so it's always good fun). Knowing that these guys are tech lovers like me, I took some expensive VR kit along to show them. And since I didn't want dozens of people, or their spawn, playing, I did it discreetly, in a spare room. However one of the kids ran in and spent the rest of the day demanding a go. She kept standing next to me or interrupting conversations and saying ""I want to play"". I did say repeatedly that it's not polite to interrupt people and maybe after everyone had finished eating we might set it up again. About fifteen minutes later said child threw up, or spat, smoothie over three people including her mother. I went home shortly after. Next time, we're going to go back to his house, the four of us, take our Xboxes, beer and pizza, and avoid relatives and kids..."

There's some good conversation happening in other threads today, but a lot of it is really heavy. So on a lighter note... most church services are pretty standard, right? They tend to follow the same basic format every week. Which means there's always that one Sunday that sticks out to you because something really strange happened. For instance, once we had a visitor get up at the end right before announcements to announce to us all that anyone who was a member of our church was in danger of the fires of Hell, because we had a woman read a scripture that morning in church. Then he hopped off the stage and left. As far as I'm aware, nobody in our church knew who he was or where he went or anything. So what about you? Strange preacher illustrations? Visitors acting up?

If she's saying that participating in any cultural phenomenon that didn't entirely originate in your own family's society is cultural appropriation, then about 95% of anything we do, ever, including the vast majority of anything these extremists try to claim others shouldn't be doing or using or wearing or experiencing, are cultural appropriation on *their* part in the first place. In other words, either *everything* is cultural appropriation, or nothing is. The very nature of culture and society is that it borrows from others. Just like literature, nothing is totally original anymore. Or, more likely, if you are labeled as a member of a group that's not at the top of the privilege food chain, then cultural appropriation doesn't apply to you anyway. Because you can't do anything wrong if you don't have power in a certain society. That's how that works. I'm gonna rip my hair out. One day this stuff won't just be the ramblings of insane people on Tumblr. One day it'll be more mainstream. These people are a danger to anyone who's actually trying to fight for equality."

One week the full-time missionaries brought a recent convert to the meeting. This guy was about my age. After the meeting I tried making small talk with him. The Relief Society room which we held our meeting in was bustling with about twenty young people. I then jokingly asked him if he had learned the secret handshake as a part off being baptized. All conversations in the room instantly ceased and all eyes focused on me. Very awkward. It wasn't til a few months later in the temple that I found out what faux pas I had committed.

Yesterday, I was waiting for my first appointment with a new psychiatrist who is supposed to help me with my anxiety. The clinic I was in also has a couple of family GPs, so there were a couple of young kids in the waiting room with their parents, who were mostly quiet. I was sitting in a corner listening to music with my headphones, when in walks this woman with her 5 small children. She sits down right across from me and starts texting or something on her phone. I'm only half paying attention, but through my music I can hear whining. I ignore it, close my eyes and pretend to sleep. A few minutes later, my headphones are pulled out of my ears. One of the little devils has my phone in her hand and is putting her sticky hand all over it. Without thinking or saying anything, I grab it back out of her hands. Bad move. She starts screaming. ""I WANNA PLAY A GAME! LET ME PLAY!"" I'm a little shocked. I say ""No."" I'm not sure what else to say. The brat starts pulling at my arm, reaching for the phone, which I hide behind my back. She is crying loudly at this point. The mother looks up from her phone and gives me a look. ""What are you doing to my kid?!"" I'm not very good at talking to people, especially strangers, and this one was yelling at me. All I got out was ""Nothing."" The little beast starts punching my legs ""SHE WON'T LET ME PLAY ON HER IPOD! I WANT TO PLAY! MAKE HER LET ME!"" The mother looks at me like I murdered a puppy. And then, ""All she wants to do is play on your phone! You goddamn racist!"" (They were black.) At this point, people are starting to stare at me. I got up and ran to the bathroom, where I stayed until I heard my name called. I didn't say anything to her. She stared at me as I walked past the waiting room.

If a club can spend 'x' pounds and get 20 points it is difficult to spend '2x' and earn 40 points or '5x' and earn 100 points. The cost needed per point increases as the total number of points increases. Still interesting though.

Long story short my husband and his sister have never gotten along, like ever. At Christmas she wanted to come see the baby. My husband responded that was fine but in order to do so he would like to discuss how she has mistreated him in the past few years to get it all out, come to a mutual understanding and be in each others lifes. Well she would rather act like nothing has ever happened and move on. Which in reality means, keep acting like she always has and we get treated like crap. So because of that, he told her she could not visit and she was not welcome. Fast forward to last week. I send out pictures and videos of the baby every month to family and friends so that they can see the baby grow up and what not. His sister has never been included in these due to her actions. Well my husband asked his mom if she had been sending those to his sister. After beating around the bush, she finally admits that she has. My husband was fuming. He asked her if she could respect his wishes and not send them to her since she is not a part of our life, to which she responds "" can you respect me?"" This was after he told her that he was on the brink of a nervous break down. What mother reacts that way? Your son tells you he's pretty much depressed and you don't seem to give a shit. My husband has done so much for his mom. He paid her bills when she got divorced and couldn't afford them. Completely ran her reception when she got married again, and has been there for her so many times. She continues to treat me, him, and even my family with complete disrespect. But oh wait it gets better. He tells her that if she wants to keep acting like this then there is no reason for her to come up this weekend. 20 minutes later we get an e mail. She informs us that she has a fast growing tumor on her uterus and is going to have a biopsy and hysterectomy. Way to throw a guilt trip on your son. My husband responds and says that he's sorry and that he hopes that they can get this resolved quickly and that he will always be there for her, but also that he feels very hurt how his feelings are always pushed to the side and treated like they don't matter. Needless to say I didn't have to deal with her this weekend, yay! However this is far from over. I hate seeing my husband so upset when all he wants is to feel loved and respected from his own family. We've been together 8 years and this is how he always gets treated. And if he sticks up for himself he's still the bad guy. Thankfully my parents are around and treat us with respect and are always willing to help us out instead of put us down."
