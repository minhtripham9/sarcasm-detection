"Why is it always physics? This is not how this works, this is not how any of this works. Quantum computers are extremely complex machines that use entanglement and superposition to allow for computing on a higher level than classical machines. Black holes are a giant mess of chaos that erases all information. Bose-Einstein condensates are a state of matter in which all particles share the same ""quantum wave"", which means that they behave in a very synchronous way. These are three very different things that you cannot simply throw together in a sentence and pray for it to sound intelligent. It doesn't! Bose-Einstein condensates can be used to simulate some aspects of black holes using sound, which is amazing. We call it *sonic black holes* and they are widely studied by the complex systems / condensed matter community. You create sound perturbations that can't escape from a fluid that is flowing more quickly than the local speed of sound, which effectively traps the sound like black holes trap light. There are many common properties between black holes and sonic black holes, it's fascinating. But I am not sure this is what your friend was thinking, though. [SEP] What",0

"I've had just the opposite. I was the custodian. (Cleaning man?) When I was in college, every winter break I would go to the temp agency and they would place you in all types of temporary jobs. Some were temporary construction where you'd only go in for a day. Some you have for weeks or the entire month break because they needed someone immediately and couldn't find a full time replacement. Anyway, this one winter I was given a custodial job in an office park, basically emptying trash and doing minor cleanups in each office. It was great because I didn't start until 530ish and could finish by 930 or 10 and go out for the night and then sleep in. Generally I didn't run into any people, as most people were gone for the night. But in one office for the first 3 nights of work I notice this beautiful lady, probably in her mid to late 30s, all alone, deep into her spreadsheets at 8pm. At first I would just knock, apologize for bothering her, change out her garbage, and wish her a good night. After I noticed her being in the office late every night I would walk in, crack some corny jokes, comment on the pictures she displayed in her office, and lamely tried to flirt, fumbling through my words. I suppose this became endearing and by the end of the second week she would seem to be relieved to see me, offering her a chance to take a break and relax for a moment. One day as I'm reaching for her garbage pail, she grabbed my biceps and said ""not too bad"" and laughed. I laughed and shook my head, thinking she was just messing with me (I'm very normal/average build) but couldn't help imagining in my 20 year old brain that this possible meaned something. The next night, she's the only person in the office again at 8 and she's dressed like it's straight out of a porno in an office setting. Tight pencil skirt, heels, a tight button down blouse, and glasses (which she didn't wear every night). I decided that after yesterday I was okay to shoot my shot so I commented that her outfit was really working for her. She smiled at me and unbuttoned one more button and asked ""does it look better like this? Or that"" as she re-buttoned the button. Without missing a beat, I replied ""did you try unbuttoning 2 more buttons?"". For some reason this makes her crack up and she stands up, approaches me, and slaps me on the chest...but then she unbuttons 2 more buttons, gets closer, and starts rubbing my chest then starts to kiss me then pulls back. She then pushes me and tells me to sit her chair. She unbuttons her shirt completely, revealing her bra, and proceeds to get on her knees and unbuckle my pants. She blows me for maybe 90 seconds total and my head is spinning and I'm done. Then she looked up at me and laughed, buttoned her self back up and said ""go on and get out of here"". I got to the bar that night and my friends drinks were on me. The next night when I walked in, I say my hello, and she proceeds to direct me steP by step exactly what I needed to do and exactly how I was going to fuck her. The first night she told me she was going to bend over the the desk, the next night she explained that she would be laying with her back on the desk and I would be finishing on her chest, the night after that she told me to sit in her chair and she would ride me. Every night for those next two weeks was slightly different but with her directing every single aspect of it. To be honest I had never experienced anything like that and it was hot as hell. For those 20 mins each night, she was completely in control of everything and it really got her off. I let her know when it was my last day and that I would be driving back to college the next afternoon. She told to pick her up on her lunch break and she blew me while I drive around town before dropping her off. I can't say any experiences that next semester in college lived up to it. We did not stay in contact after that. [SEP] Don't care if it's true... this deserves to be higher.",0

"Why are the cooldowns on toys so sporadic and weird? Title. The cooldowns for Toys seem rather arbitrarily implemented, without any concern for what the toy actually does. Gamon's Braid has a 2-hour cooldown, Iron Boot Flask has a 1-hour cooldown. I looked back through previous posts but none of them really seem helpful. ""It ruins the flavor of WoW if you can just spam them constantly."" Makes little sense depending on how long you play. If a *majority* of people play for 5+ hours a day, then alright, I could see limiting the use of Toys. But some of them just have baffling CDs for no real reason. Hell, Moroes' Famous Polish is debatably more ""game-changing"" than either of the above because it shows your character as being as naked as possible, but it only has a 30 minute CD by comparison. Spirit of Bashiok summons the dancing tree that's on fire for like 3-5 minutes, but has an hour CD, whereas Archmage Vargoth's Spare Staff has a 2 minute cooldown and lasts around the same time as far as I'm aware. Even if the items all cause strain on the servers, which I'm sure they do when spammed (Like the Haunted Memento's ghost thing apparently), that doesn't change the inconsistency with regards to the cooldowns. How is the cooldown decided? Orb of Deception lets you change into a member of the Horde for 5 minutes with a 30-minute CD. Iron Boot Flask makes you an Iron Dwarf for 10 minutes with an hour CD. The Bloodmane Charm makes you into a Saberon, with a 30-minute CD too. It's not like all of them are abuseable in some way. Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I just can't wrap my head around it. [SEP] The more fun the toy, the longer the cooldown.",0

"So, a bit of backstory first. A few years back (summer after our second year of university) a buddy and I were at a party in a rural university town about an hour outside of the city where we grew up. It was a fairly big party and there were tons of people there, including a few guys my buddy played football against. Everything was going well, it was getting late, and my girlfriend came to pick me up, so I took off. About fifteen minutes later I got the phone call: things had turned ugly after I left, and someone sucker-punched my buddy. The way he fell, he fractured his skull, had to be evac'd by helicopter to the city, where he underwent hours and hours of surgery. The next year or two was a brutal, brutal recovery period. At first they weren't sure if he'd ever be able to play sports again, much less a concussive sport like football. Against all odds, he trained his ass off, and was back on the field a year and a half later, for his fourth year of eligibility. That fourth year, his school (a different rural university town outside of the city) had homecoming. At their homecoming game, they played against the team that rostered the guy who had hit him (let's call him Punchy for clarity's sake.) Anyway, my buddy's team shitstomped Punchy's team all afternoon, and ended up winning by a few touchdowns, with a particularly gifted performance by my buddy. Later in the night, we were at the bar (THE bar, not A bar) drinking like fish and celebrating a big win, and ultimately, his return to being successful at football. Later in the evening, we look up, and who should come swaggering over to the table but Punchy and a couple of his boys. Me and my buddy both stood up, along with one of the D-linemen on his team, ready for whatever. After the usual macho back-and-forth shit-talking between the athletes, Punchy leaned in with a smirk and asked my buddy ""how's your head?"" Without even missing a beat, I swear to God, my buddy took a quick crowhop forward and HEADBUTTED Punchy square in the face. We heard a crack, and Punchy immediately hit the floor and began leaking blood. The rest of the night predictably turned to shit, but before the chaos ensued, my buddy stood over Punchy and replied ""you tell me."" May not be the wittiest comeback I've ever heard of, but it was damn sure the most effective. [SEP] Tell your friend I like him.",0

"I am incredibly addicted to smash Pretty much ever since EVO, I've been super addicted to smash bros. The first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning is playing or watching smash. Whenever I'm not doing homework or working, I am watching youtube videos about smash or playing the game. Actually, even while working/doing homework, I listen to smash bros music or interviews, like old interviews from top players at past tournaments. In fact, as I'm typing this, I am listening to a PPMD interview from 2014. While I'm eating dinner/breakfast, I am simultaneously watching or listening to something related to smash. I even sometimes make little fantasies in my head about what would happen if I went back in time to 2005 or other time periods with the skill I have now and I imagine myself dominating. (I'm a decent sheik/falco player, but I would be incredible in 2005). I find myself watching the same interviews twice. Whenever I don't have anything to watch, I find some random tournament that I haven't seen yet or I rewatch sets. I've probably watched the Mew2king vs Leffen 6-0 like 30 times. And let me tell you this: I've never been happier. Thank you Smash brothers. [SEP] Become a mod on here and you'll be sure to get sick of it fast enough",1

"The general public... I've always worked with the general public. It's horrible. When I was in college I worked at my stepdad's car wash. The dumbest people are in cars. Here's some of my craziest customers. Some silly things would happen frequently, like there's 3 lanes, but everyone will pile into one lane and fuss if someone else's car was finished before theirs. The only time I've only lost my cool with one these customers. I was helping a customer, and a lady was pulling up behind him instead of pulling into one of the other open lanes. I pointed to direct her on where to go. When I finished helping him, I went to greet her. She flings her door open and starts screaming at me for being rude, and shouting ""Pointing doesn't let me know where to go!"" I say ""I'm sorry ma'am. I was just trying to get you into an empty lane so we can get to your car quicker."" She yells ""You should've walked over here and pointed out the open lane!"" I tell her that I was taking a customer's order and I couldn't walk off, and then I go on to try to take her order. She keeps shouting and insulting me. After five minutes of this I'm done helping, and say ""Okay. I'm not going to walk away from a customer to point at an empty space in the lot because you don't have enough common sense to go there. Someone else will come get your order."" Another man was old and thought that women should only cook and bear children. He was always so nice to the men, but really rude to me. I would give everyone the same speech. ""Just leave your car in park and the keys in the ignition. Give this ticket to the cashier. Thank you, and have a nice day!"" He would respond by shaking his finger in my face and saying ""Don't you fucking tell me what to do!"" We would offer a free exterior rewash if you brought your receipt back within 2 days. This one woman that was the definition of a prude would always come in for her rewash. She would never have her receipt with her. She would always say ""They've never asked for my receipt before."" After about the 9th time I told her ""Ma'am, I am always the one that takes your order. I tell you every single time that you have to bring your receipt back. You have only paid for one wash out of the last 10. You can not have a wash today unless you pay for it."" She gets huffy and purses her lips and says ""Excuse me? Are you accusing me of lying? You know that I make more money than you, right?"" I say ""Oh, you do? Then you shouldn't have a problem buying a $5.00 wash."" When she goes into the wash her car started jumping over the rollers that push your car through. So now her car is stuck in the middle of the wash. We shut it off and she rolls down her window and starts yelling about how we're incompetent and our washing is messing her car up. We tell her to make sure she's in neutral and not touching the brakes or steering wheel. ""I'm not stupid. I know how to go through a car wash."" Her car jumps the rollers again, except this time we're watching and see her brake lights come on as soon as the rollers start moving her. She starts yelling that she wants her money back because we're going to mess up her car. ""Ma'am, we just watched you put your brakes on. If anything, you're going to mess up our wash. You will not be getting a refund."" AANNNDD the best. There was a really really old lady that would come in. She was one of those people that comes to a complete stop before turning her wheel to turn in somewhere. I always knew she was coming in because I could hear people on the street honking at her. I would always meet her car before she got to where she needed to be because I didn't want her to drive anymore. One time she refused to get out and wanted to drive her car through the wash herself. I was standing down the lot and directing her on where to go. She hits the gas, hits me, I flip over the top of her car, land on the concrete, watch her jump the curb(as she hits a shopping cart that flies so fast it sticks in a wooden fence), go into the lot next door and do a donut, and hop back over the curb and crash into the side of our building. We had to share an ambulance. She was 90 years old and her kids weren't keeping her from driving or watching over her. She was holding the gas in the whole time, thinking it was the brake. Out of all that time she didn't think that maybe she's not pressing the brake. [SEP] I'm sorry you were hit by a car, that is certainly no laughing matter, but... your description of the old lady with a lead foot had me giggling!",0

I feel perfectly comfortable being a man and do not have any desires to become a woman in real life nor do I have any desires to be with another man.

I don't feel the need to ""relate"" to my avatar, I enjoy the fantasy aspect of it just being fantasy and nothing to do with real life. My friends used to make fun of me in the beginning with games like World of Warcraft many years ago. It didn't bother me one bit cause that's how we all treat each other, we make fun of each other and tease each other and it was all fun and good. However, with the recent Pokemon GO app things have turned weird. I picked a female avatar like I always do and some of my friends who usually don't play games started playing as well. They found it weird that I had a female avatar. Some of them started asking me intimate questions like ""are you feeling okay with your gender?"" or do you have any problems that you are too ashamed to mention? They all refer to my avatar and how strange it is. I keep denying it but they never believe me. What can I tell them? **TL;DR**: I like having female avatars in video games. People don't get it and thing I want to change my gender or question my sexuality.

One day, I had an extra 30 minutes or so to kill before my shift started, so I decided to go to the electronics store next door. You know, the big blue one with the yellow price tag logo. I was shopping around in my red shirt (with the bullseye on the front) and khaki pants when an elderly lady and who I assume was her grandson walked up to me. The lady asked if I knew where a certain CD was, because it wasn't where she thought it would be. I told her that I didn't work there, and wasn't very familiar with the layout of the store. She responded with, ""Well, maybe you shouldn't wear an employee's shirt if you're not an employee!"" I didn't quite know what to say to this, as I thought my shirt was very clearly red, and the actual employees' shirts were very clearly blue. Luckily, I didn't have to respond, because she stormed off before I had a chance to say anything. [SEP] You ever wonder why we're here?",0

The trustee, who gets allowance from the state to handle abandoned and poor people, who can't afford a proper burial/cremation.

"in a nutshell: The moon's gravitational pull on the earth distorts the surface, causing it to be (slightly) egg shaped -- the longitudinal axis of this imaginary ""egg"" is always pointing towards the moon. As the moon orbits the earth, this distortion of the earth is manifest in the rise and fall of the tides. There is a similar effect caused by the tug of the sun on the earth, though to a lesser extent. However, when the two forces line up, you get the spring tide (highest of the high tides) which occurs during the Full moon.

"My friend and his girlfriend made his party ""couples only"" last minute and pretty much left me out to dry 7 hours before it started last night Hi Reddit, so I have never used this site before. I was actually recommend it by a family friend. So I live in Pennsylvania and I just completed my Sophomore year. I was super excited to be on summer break and just relax over the summer. My friends had organised this party last night to celebrate and just have a good time. I normally dress really smart just in general because I care about my appearance. Yesterday morning at around 11 am I got a phone call from my friend that was hosting the party. I answered my phone and he goes "" Bro, you need to find a date"". I was confused as holy hell as to why, so I did the natural thing and asked him. He said "" Bro, I and Sasha (girlfriend) have made the party couples only. You need to find a date or you can't come."" Before I even had a chance to respond he hang up on me. So I sat in my room thinking Christ, where am I going to find a date. All the girls I know really well are in relationships and who is going to want to go on a date now on such short notice. So I sent him a text telling him this and he said "" Sorry bro, you can't come then"". I had 7 hours to find a date. If you can find a date in 7 hours more power to you, but to me that sounds like an impossible task. I decided fuck it, I don't need this I am going to go out by myself. I went down to the mall. The mall near my place has this outside part to it. It is mainly restaurants and stuff but they stay open way after the mall closes. I hanged around there and there was a local band so I just listened to them. But the whole night it was bugging me that 7 hours before the party they told me this. Where the hell was I suppose to find a date in 7 hours. Did they expect me to wave my magic wand and make one appear. All the girls I know already have boyfriends and, I was stranded. Do I even bring this up to them or do I just leave it alone and move on? **tl;dr**: Friends made a party couples only and only gave me 7 hours notice.

"During a eulogy for my grandfather, I said that he was the person I most loved in the world. My wife and I have been fighting now because of it. She thinks I did something wrong. I think she's being a brat. We've been married now for 2 years, and before that we dated for 3 years. Altogether we've been a couple for around 5 years. Let me start off by saying that I do love my wife and our soon-to-be son a lot. They are certainly 2 of the most important people in my life, but they are or were not the person I loved most. That was and always will be my grandfather for a host of different reasons. I think it should suffice to say that he raised me and did so many things to help me become the person I am today. Without him, I would be nothing, and that is why he holds such a special place in my life. I said as much at his funeral a few weeks back, and I'm not sorry for what I said. I could have understated things or chosen different words, but that is how I feel. To say or pretend otherwise would be a lie, and it's not like it's ever been a secret where my grandfather ranked in my life. I'm just not sure what my wife wants or expects of me. I can't change how I feel about my grandfather, but just because he was the person I cared for the most doesn't mean I don't deeply and truly love her or our future son. I know that it's disappointing for her to hear that I don't love her above everyone else, but I can't change that. The bottom line is, she wants me to take back what I said and apologize, but I don't feel like I did anything wrong. I'm not trying to be mean, but I don't know how she can ask that of me given how much he meant to me. I would be nothing without him, but without her I would still have a nice life. The two aren't comparable in any way. I would like to just move on and focus on preparing for our son's birth, but she can't seem to get past this. On the other hand, I can't bring myself to take back what I said, and it makes me angry that she's behaving like a child at such a bad time. We're at a huge impasse, and I don't know how to get us past this. Help/advice would be appreciated. --- **tl;dr**: Said in a eulogy for my grandfather that he was the most important person in my life. Wife got upset because she and our unborn son are not #1 in my world and now wants me to take it back and apologize. I refuse to do so since it is true and I can't help how I feel, not to mention my grandfather did far more for me than she or anyone else ever has, and she can't get past this. Don't know what to do. [SEP] For me, if I was carrying my husbands child, it would be a real blow to the chest for him to hold on to the stance that his life would still be pretty good without us, and that we're not just as important as a member of his family essentially.",0

"I've dated, been with other girls, hit the gym every day, worked on my career, but I'm consumed with thoughts of my ex and it's making life really hard. Been 3 months. Advice? We were together 5 years and she broke it off in January because she thought it wasn't going anywhere. I admit it was because I didn't do the things that showed I was committed. I see why she had to go. Towards the end I thought I wanted to break up too. But I see now how incredibly stupid that was. I won't go into details. I love that girl so much. I've been out with new women, spent time with friends, hit the gym almost every day, been working on changing careers. But the thoughts of her are eating me alive guys. I've never experienced anything this difficult in my life. That girl is my world and I wasn't able to then give her what she deserved, or at least I thought I wasn't. I had some issues I should have addressed earlier on but I didn't know how to. I don't have a very good support group; very fragmented family and friends that aren't the best with real ""life stuff"". So I was juggling too much. Anyway, I just think that this is starting to get unhealthy. I'm doing healthy things like I should be, but nothing works. I honestly feel like that sweet beautiful girl and me were meant for each other but I fucked it up and ended up hurting her. It's the most agonizing pain I've ever dealt with.

"Please don't play evil characters or characters who obviously don't fit in with the rest of the party. People who are new to the idea of alignment always equate evil=psycho. An evil person is not always a sadistic lunatic. A lot of the time they don't see themselves as evil at all. They love their mothers and their dog, they make friends, and they do nice things for people. Just because they're willing to commit evil acts doesn't mean they don't follow their own sense of morality. Also, most evil people understand that acting outside of the norm will get them in trouble and they will avoid that attention. The edgy ""evil"" character who murders the helpless prisoner in front of the entire party and then acts ""baffled"" when everyone is offended will not and should not last long. The right kind of evil player would wait until the party is asleep, fake an injury before stabbing the prisoner in the chest, and then convince everyone that they were attacked and the prisoner was trying to escape. Or he would attempt to corrupt the party, convincing them with smooth words why killing the prisoner is the best course of action and offer to do it himself to spare everyone else the deed.

"Camille deserves nerfs - but lets do it right I've spammed the ever loving hell out of camille lately and have just recently hit mastery 7 on her, and I can confirm that she is busted. However I feel like what riot generally ends up doing is just nerfing the base stats or damage of a champ like her until she is effectively gutted. There are less drastic ways to nerf her that will still keep her as a viable pick, but not as oppressive. The main thing with her that makes her hilariously busted in my opinion is her ability to trade for free in lane with little to no counterplay for most opposing toplaners. Unless you are playing jax, poppy, or fiora, camille's lane is almost as abusive as renektons with her also scaling better into the game. The main issue is the q2 prep e-aa-q combo, which can deal an upwards of a third of someones health with absolutely no way to deal with it. So what are the best ways to nerf her? -Increased e cooldown in the early levels by a lot, I feel like a ~20 second cd will keep her ability to trade for free down -Remove attack speed buff on e, its a completely unnecessary stat boost and I'm not quite sure why its there -Make her shield health percentage scale by level, starting at 10% and increasing to 20% These nerfs will serve to bring her back in line without going too far, if she still needs nerfs after that she can get looked at again [SEP] How about just reduce her base AD by 5.",1

No one really responded so I dropped it. Then all through the rest of the night both of them would point to my young cousins (4 and 6, I think?) and say ""how could you not want one?!""

"So long, and thanks for all the fish, Azeroth Let me just start out this post by saying this isn't an average ""I'm quitting"" post as after this, I will not be around for much longer but first of all I want to say thank you Blizzard, thank you for the countless years on this game that have brought me and my family much joy. Second, thank you to the community who make this game what it is today, trolls, toxic ninja looters and nice guy's alike. What's a wow journey without some asshole stealing the trinket you wanted for ages then mass kicking everyone? I'll try not to waffle on too much but I've said it a few times in this subreddit before, my father and brother both played wow. We had a family account we loved to play, my father passed away in 2011 along with my mother later in the year. My brother got the account banned and I made my own in 2012 after months of what I'd like to call hell, my brother was a drug addict after our parents died, we were living in poverty and hounded by debt collectors. Later that year I pulled us over 1000km away from that and we started a life here, but I never got better, WoW was that one outlet for me that really helped me keep stable, helped me stay social even though I left the house less than once a month. Raiding was a huge passion of mine as I couldn't work anymore like I used to and felt I was fulfilling some purpose, after caring for my dying mother for 3 years, I lost the will to live for myself, and have now for the last 5 years, dedicated my life to my brother and getting him better which he slowly is and I feel safe enough now to let him live his life on his own. Thank you for the years of happiness, thank you for the years of keeping me afloat but unfortunately over the last 6 months however, I've been declining in mental and physical health quite rapidly, I was diagnosed with multiple permanent illnesses that have a good chance of getting much worse than they are and i'm showing the signs of others, and I do not want to continue on letting them worsen and I have stopped my medication, I am also at very high risk of what killed my mother (and her father, and my fathers mother, etc) and I do not want to go like they did. I loved this game, and I hope it continues to be made well after I am gone, although I will be spending the next few months setting up for my departure. I am going to log out in my favourite spot, The Secret Aerie pond, looking out into the mountains and the sky in Pandaria for one last time before giving my account to someone I love very dearly, who I have had to say goodbye to in order to save him from hurting. I don't know when the end will come, but its inevitable. Again, thank you for having me Azeroth, dioniss aca From, just your average Draenei Mage. [SEP] Light be with you, friend.",0

"When my oldest son was in 8th grade, he decided to make money by doing his classmates homework. I knew something was up because he spent an extraordinary time doing homework, while his twin sister who shared some classes with him, didn't. He would be up until nearly midnight doing homework. It seemed weird and when I would question him about it, he would just make up odd excuses. I found money in his pockets while doing laundry and since he didn't have a job, that didn't sit right. I asked my younger son if he knew why his brother had money in his pocket and he told me what was up. He was apparently paying his brother and sister as well to keep quiet. After I found out, I told my son that I was going to call his teachers and see why he was being given so much homework. My son immediately told me not to do that, so I told him that I wouldn't call. Instead, the following day when I drove the kids to school, I got out of the car with my son and told him that I wanted to talk to the principal in person. I told my son that his teachers were being absolutely ridiculous and I had to go above them if I wanted anything to be done. My son confessed before we got to the school. *Before anyone says it, I am not the type of parent to go to the principal or teachers over homework. I wasn't actually going to it. Just wanted to frighten my son. [SEP] Did the younger brother give back the hush money since he blabbed and therefore didn't earn it?",0

"""How are we supposed to shop then?"" Hello TFR! This lovely tale happened just Saturday. I work for a lesser-known store that sells anything from furniture to food to nifty little trinkets. We close at 9p Mon-Sat, and 7p on Sun. As many retail store workers can understand, lots of customers don't pay attention these hours. Apologies for any formatting issues, as I'm on mobile. The other day, Saturday, I was working the cash register. My basic duties include ringing people up, answering questions, greeting, etc. We close at 9p, just to reiterate. So I'm greeting, and some people walk up to ask me questions about where a particular rug is, what chairs might go with it, stuff like that. I answer what I can and then offer to call someone over to the rug section. They then ask, ""what time do you close again?"" Me: ""oh, 9o'clock tonight."" Looked at the clock, it was a bit before 7 I believe. Them: ""oh that's terrible! That's way too early. How are we supposed to shop and get out in time?""
